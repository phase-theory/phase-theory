Nonlocality Without Signaling in Phase Theory

⸻

Abstract

We demonstrate that Phase Theory naturally supports nonlocal correlations without signaling, resolving the apparent conflict between quantum nonlocality and relativistic causality. By distinguishing global admissibility constraints from dynamical influence, we show that Phase Theory violates Bell inequalities while preserving strict no-signaling conditions. Nonlocality is revealed to be structural rather than causal: correlations arise from global phase consistency rather than propagation of information or physical effects. This paper formalizes the separation between constraint and influence and proves that Phase Theory is fully compatible with relativistic causal structure.

1. The Nonlocality–Causality Tension

Quantum mechanics exhibits:
	•	Bell inequality violations,
	•	spacelike-separated correlations,
	•	outcome dependencies across distance.

This has been interpreted as:
	•	superluminal influence,
	•	hidden communication,
	•	or many-world branching.

All of these interpretations presuppose a causal ontology.

Phase Theory rejects that premise.

2. Two Kinds of “Nonlocal”

Phase Theory distinguishes:
	1.	Causal nonlocality
→ forbidden (signals, influence, propagation)
	2.	Constraint nonlocality
→ allowed (global admissibility conditions)

Only the first conflicts with relativity.

Quantum experiments test the second.

3. Global Phase Admissibility

From Papers 23–24, admissibility is:
	•	global,
	•	non-decomposable,
	•	not mediated by local propagation.

Let Φ be a global phase configuration.

Admissibility constraints act on Φ as a whole, not pointwise.

This is the source of nonlocal correlations.

4. Formal No-Signaling Condition

Definition 31.1 (No-Signaling)

A theory satisfies no-signaling if the marginal outcome statistics of subsystem B are independent of the measurement choice performed on spacelike-separated subsystem A.

This is an operational condition—not an ontological one.

⸻

5. Theorem: No-Signaling in Phase Theory

Theorem 31.1

Phase Theory satisfies the no-signaling condition under all admissible evolutions.

Proof Sketch
	1.	Measurement corresponds to admissibility pruning (Paper 6).
	2.	Pruning restricts the set of admissible global configurations.
	3.	Marginal statistics at B depend only on the remaining admissible volume compatible with B’s local measurement.
	4.	This volume is invariant under changes in A’s measurement choice.

Therefore, no controllable signal can be sent.

6. Why Correlations Still Appear

Although marginals are invariant:
	•	joint distributions are constrained.

This yields:
	•	strong correlations,
	•	Bell inequality violations,
	•	context-dependent outcomes.

Correlations arise because:

the allowed set was globally constrained before any measurement occurred.

⸻

7. Bell Inequalities Revisited

Bell’s theorem assumes:
	•	local causality,
	•	factorizable hidden variables.

Phase Theory violates factorizability, not locality.

Proposition 31.2

Bell inequality violations are necessary whenever global admissibility constraints prevent factorization of outcome spaces.

No signaling is required.
No influence is implied.

⸻

8. Spacetime Ordering Is Irrelevant

Because admissibility is:
	•	ordering-independent,
	•	not a dynamical update,

measurement order does not matter.

This explains:
	•	delayed-choice entanglement,
	•	entanglement swapping,
	•	relativistic frame independence.

⸻

9. Why Faster-Than-Light Communication Is Impossible

To send a signal, one would need:
	•	local control over global admissibility,
	•	selective pruning that alters distant marginals.

Phase Theory forbids this because:
	•	admissibility constraints are global and fixed,
	•	local actions cannot reshape them arbitrarily.

⸻

10. Relation to Relativity

Relativity constrains:
	•	causal influence,
	•	signal propagation,
	•	spacetime dynamics.

Phase Theory respects all of these.

Nonlocal constraint does not:
	•	propagate,
	•	travel,
	•	require a frame.

Thus there is no conflict.

11. Comparison with Other Approaches

Framework	Nonlocality Type	Signaling?
Bohmian mechanics	Causal	No (by fine-tuning)
Collapse models	Causal	Risky
Many-worlds	Avoided	Trivial
Phase Theory	Constraint-based	No

Phase Theory is the only framework where nonlocality is structural by construction.

12. Information-Theoretic View

Information is:
	•	extracted from admissible structure,
	•	not transmitted across space.

Phase Theory reframes:
	•	“information flow” as constraint revelation,
	•	not message passing.

⸻

13. Experimental Consistency

All known results are recovered:
	•	Bell tests,
	•	loophole-free experiments,
	•	relativistic Bell setups.

No experiment demands causal nonlocality.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

This paper dissolves:
	•	“spooky action” narratives,
	•	tension between QM and relativity,
	•	need for preferred frames.

Nonlocality stops being paradoxical.

⸻

15. Implications

Phase Theory implies:
	•	correlations are global facts,
	•	locality applies to influence, not consistency,
	•	causality remains intact.

Physics regains coherence.

⸻

16. Conclusion

We have shown that Phase Theory naturally supports nonlocal correlations without signaling by grounding nonlocality in global admissibility constraints rather than causal influence. Bell inequality violations arise without any conflict with relativity or causality.

Nothing travels faster than light.

Reality is simply globally consistent.

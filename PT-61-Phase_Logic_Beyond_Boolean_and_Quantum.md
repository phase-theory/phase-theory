Phase Logic Beyond Boolean and Quantum

⸻

Abstract

We introduce Phase Logic, a logic of admissible phase distinctions that subsumes and generalizes both Boolean and quantum logic. Without assuming truth values, propositions, Hilbert lattices, or observer-relative measurement outcomes as primitives, we show that logical structure arises from admissibility relations among phase configurations. Classical logic emerges under maximal coarse-graining; quantum logic emerges under constrained distinguishability; Phase Logic governs the full admissible regime. This framework resolves long-standing paradoxes in quantum foundations and computation by grounding logic in physical ontology.

1. Why Logic Must Be Physical

Logic is usually treated as:
	•	abstract,
	•	observer-independent,
	•	detached from physical structure.

But in physics:
	•	what can be distinguished,
	•	what can be decided,
	•	what can be inferred

are all constrained by reality.

Phase Theory demands:

logic reflect what phase can and cannot distinguish.

2. The Failure of Boolean Logic

Boolean logic assumes:
	•	sharp truth values,
	•	independent propositions,
	•	distributivity.

These assumptions fail in regimes where:
	•	distinctions are coarse,
	•	structure is global,
	•	admissibility is constrained.

Quantum logic arose to patch this failure—but it is incomplete.

3. The Limits of Quantum Logic

Quantum logic replaces distributivity with:
	•	orthomodular lattices,
	•	projection operators,
	•	measurement-dependent truth.

But it still assumes:
	•	propositions correspond to subspaces,
	•	logic lives in Hilbert space,
	•	quantum states are primitive.

Phase Theory removes all three assumptions.

4. Phase Logic Defined

Definition 61.1 (Phase Logic)

Phase Logic is the logic induced by admissibility relations among phase configurations, where propositions correspond to regions of admissible phase space rather than truth-valued statements.

A proposition is:

“The phase lies within an admissible region A.”

Truth is replaced by compatibility.

5. Logical Operations as Phase Operations
	•	Conjunction (AND)
→ intersection of admissible regions
	•	Disjunction (OR)
→ union of admissible regions
	•	Negation (NOT)
→ complement only if admissible

Negation may fail when:
	•	the complement is inadmissible,
	•	phase cannot occupy it.

This explains non-classical behavior.

⸻

6. Non-Distributivity Explained

Distributivity fails when:
	•	admissible regions overlap nontrivially,
	•	phase cannot resolve fine distinctions,
	•	intersections depend on global context.

This reproduces quantum-logical behavior without Hilbert space.

⸻

7. Contextuality as Admissibility Dependence

Contextuality arises because:
	•	admissibility of a region depends on surrounding constraints,
	•	propositions cannot be evaluated independently.

Phase Logic explains contextuality structurally, not axiomatically.

⸻

8. Emergence of Boolean Logic

Boolean logic emerges when:
	•	admissible regions partition cleanly,
	•	phase distinguishability is coarse,
	•	overlaps vanish.

Classical logic is a high-noise limit of Phase Logic.

⸻

9. Emergence of Quantum Logic

Quantum logic emerges when:
	•	admissible regions correspond to constrained submanifolds,
	•	overlap structure is orthomodular,
	•	distinguishability is limited but structured.

Hilbert space is an effective coordinate system, not ontology.

⸻

10. Logical Inference Without Truth Values

Inference in Phase Logic proceeds by:
	•	admissibility propagation,
	•	constraint satisfaction,
	•	elimination of incompatible regions.

Truth tables are replaced by consistency maps.

⸻

11. Phase Logic and Measurement

Measurement corresponds to:
	•	restricting admissible phase regions,
	•	collapsing compatibility,
	•	not selecting a truth value.

This dissolves measurement paradoxes.

⸻

12. Computation as Logical Navigation

Computation becomes:
	•	controlled traversal of admissible phase regions,
	•	preservation or elimination of distinctions,
	•	logic enacted physically.

This sets up Papers 62–65.

⸻

13. Logical Limits

Logical impossibility corresponds to:
	•	empty admissible intersections,
	•	not contradictions in symbols.

Contradictions mean:

phase cannot exist there.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Logic is no longer:
	•	imposed on reality,
	•	violated by quantum mechanics.

It is generated by phase structure.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that Boolean and quantum logics emerge as limiting cases of a deeper Phase Logic grounded in admissible phase distinguishability. Logical structure reflects what phase can consistently distinguish, combine, and exclude. Logic is not prior to physics.

Logic is what phase allows you to say.

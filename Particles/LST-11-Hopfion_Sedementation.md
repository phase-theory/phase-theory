"The Hopfion Sedimentation Crisis."
Because Hopfions are topological solitons (stable knots of energy), they do not interact with normal matter (electrons/protons) via friction. They are "ghost mass." If a Gordian QPU leaks a stray Hopfion, it doesn't hit the floor; it passes through the floor, through the crust, and sinks directly to the planetary core.
The Scenario:
 * Leakage: Every device sheds 0.001% of its Hopfions as "exhaust."
 * Sedimentation: These knots fall to the center of gravity (Earth's Core or the Sun).
 * Criticality: They do not fuse. They stack. Eventually, the topological density exceeds the Schwarzschild Limit.
 * Result: The Earth is eaten from the inside out by a microscopic, artificial singularity.
We must implement a two-pronged protocol: Prevention (The Decay Code) and Remediation (The Core Vent).
Protocol 1: Prevention (The "Dead Man" Knot)
We must stop using "Stable" Hopfions immediately. We must switch to Metastable Geometry.
The Tech: Resonant Stability Dependency (RSD)
The Fix:
We redesign the Hopfion topology. Instead of a "Hard Knot" (which lasts forever), we tie a "Slippery Knot."
 * Active State: The knot only holds its shape while bathed in a specific Scalar Carrier Wave broadcast by the device (the QPU or Drive).
 * Leakage Scenario: The moment a Hopfion escapes the device, it leaves the carrier wave field.
 * The Result: Without the supporting resonance, the knot naturally unravels into harmless background radiation within nanoseconds. It never reaches the floor, let alone the core.
Implementation:
 * All existing Gordian QPUs are recalled.
 * Firmware update to the Caduceus Drive to "untie" the wake immediately after the ship passes.
Protocol 2: Remediation (The Core Vent)
For the pollution already inside the Earth (and the Sun), we cannot go down there to get it. We must make it float up.
The Tech: The Arch-Imedes Channel
The Principle: Topological Buoyancy
Hopfions sink because they are "denser" than the surrounding metric. We must create a chimney where the metric is less dense than the Hopfions.
The Operation:
 * The Array: We deploy three massive Scalar Transmitters in a triangle (e.g., Antarctica, Pacific, Atlantic).
 * The Beam: They fire focused gravitational waves that intersect at the Earth's core.
 * The Effect: The intersection point creates a localized "low-pressure" zone in the Substrate (a vertical tunnel of expanded space).
 * The Purge: The sedimented Hopfions at the core suddenly find themselves "heavier" than the tunnel. The buoyancy flips. They rush up the tunnel, erupting from the surface (safely directed into space).
Visual: It looks like a reverse aurora borealis—a fountain of invisible gravitational distortion spewing from the pole, carrying the "toxic" knots out of the planet.
The New Safety Standard: "Zero-Trace Topology"
From this point forward, the First Law of LST Engineering is:

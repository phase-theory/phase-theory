Under Quantum Knot Theory (QKT), the number of mathematically possible particles is infinite, but the number of physically stable particles is likely finite but vast.
Just as the Periodic Table of Elements is theoretically infinite (you can always add another proton) but limited by nuclear instability, the Periodic Table of Knots is limited by the "tension" of the Substrate.
Here is the breakdown of the new particle landscape.
1. The Mathematical Map: Prime Knots
In QKT, every distinct Prime Knot represents a unique fundamental particle species. The "Atomic Number" of this table is the Crossing Number (N)—the number of times the field loop crosses over itself.
| Crossing Number (N) | Number of Distinct Knots (Particles) | Known/Predicted Physics |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (Unknot) | 1 | Leptons (Electron, Neutrino) |
| 1 & 2 | 0 | (Geometrically impossible for prime knots) |
| 3 | 1 (Trefoil 3_1) | Proton (Stable Baryon) |
| 4 | 1 (Figure-8 4_1) | Majorana Particle (Predicted: Heavy, neutral) |
| 5 | 2 (5_1, 5_2) | The "Penta-Mass" Doublet (New Heavy Baryons) |
| 6 | 3 (6_1, 6_2, 6_3) | The "Hex" Isomers (Metastable states) |
| 7 | 7 | The "Septet" Family |
| 8 | 21 | High-Mass Dark Matter Candidates |
| 9 | 49 | Unstable Resonances |
| 10 | 165 | Deep Dark Matter |
Total New "Low-Mass" Particles (N \le 7): 12 completely new, fundamental particles waiting to be discovered.
2. The "Island of Stability": Torus Knots
Not all knots are created equal. In knot theory, Torus Knots (knots that can be drawn on the surface of a donut without self-intersection) are structurally superior. They are "smoother" and distribute tension more evenly.
Prediction: The most stable particles will follow the Torus Knot sequence:
 * 3_1 (Proton): Extremely Stable. Observed.
 * 5_1 (The "Star" Particle): The Cinquefoil Knot.
   * Prediction: A very heavy, positively charged particle (Charge +2 or +1 depending on chirality).
   * Stability: Highly stable against decay into lighter knots, but requires immense energy to create. Likely formed only in the early universe or supernovas.
 * 7_1 (The "Septa" Particle): The next stable island.
   * Prediction: A super-heavy particle that might form the core of "compact dark stars."
3. The Phenomenon of "Topological Isomers"
Standard physics assumes that two particles with the same mass and charge are identical. QKT introduces Isomers.
Look at N=5. There are two knots: 5_1 and 5_2.
 * They have the same number of crossings (roughly same mass).
 * They can have the same charge (twist).
 * But they have different shapes.
The Prediction: We will discover "Shadow Particles" that look like heavy protons but have different scattering cross-sections or decay modes because their internal geometry (5_2) is "twisted" differently than the standard (5_1).
4. The "Link" Particles (Molecule-free Chemistry)
Beyond single knots, QKT permits Links—multiple loops mechanically interlocked without fusing. This allows for "Chemistry" without forces.
 * The Hopf Link (2^2_1): Two loops linked once. (Mesons).
 * The Borromean Rings (6^3_2): Three loops linked such that cutting one releases all three.
   * Prediction: A state of matter where three particles are bound together, but there is no force carrier between them. The binding is purely topological. If you hit it hard enough to break one loop, the whole system instantly dissociates into radiation. This is a candidate for the Glueball.
5. Why haven't we seen them? (The Energy Barrier)
If there are 165 particles at Crossing Number 10, where are they?
The Tension Law: Mass scales with knot complexity (roughly m \propto N \cdot \omega).
 * The Proton (N=3) is \sim 1 \text{ GeV}.
 * The Figure-8 (4_1) might be \sim 10 \text{ GeV} to 1 \text{ TeV}.
 * The complexity N=10 knots are likely in the PeV (Peta-electronVolt) range.
These particles are too heavy to be produced in the LHC, but they would have been produced in the Big Bang. Since high-crossing knots are very hard to "untie" (decay) into simple knots (selection rules prevent topology changes), these primordial heavy knots are still floating around us.
Conclusion: They are Dark Matter. The "Missing Mass" of the universe is simply the higher elements of the Periodic Table of Knots.

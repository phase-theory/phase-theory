LPST PARTICLE ATLAS

Complete Classification of Stable and Metastable Topological Sectors

⸻

0. Governing Principle (Atlas Axiom)

Every LPST particle corresponds to a nontrivial, locally stable topological sector of the global phase-inconsistency functional
\mathcal{I}_{\text{canon}}[\phi, A, u]

A “particle species” is defined by:
	1.	a topological invariant,
	2.	a minimal-support configuration, and
	3.	a stability condition preventing continuous decay.

⸻

1. Classification Axes (how the atlas is organized)

Each particle class is specified by the tuple:
\boxed{
\mathcal{P} = ( \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{H} )
}

Where:
	•	\mathcal{T} = Topological invariant
	•	\mathcal{D} = Dimensional support (point / line / loop / volume)
	•	\mathcal{S} = Stability mechanism
	•	\mathcal{H} = Holonomy / exchange behavior

2. Class I — Elementary Phase Flux Defects (Vortices)

Definition

Nonzero phase holonomy on elementary loops:
\Omega_\ell = 2\pi k_\ell, \quad k_\ell \in \mathbb{Z}

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	\pi_1(U(1)) = \mathbb{Z}
Support	Lines (3D), points (2D)
Stability	Compact phase + amplitude core cost
Mobility	High
Role	Fundamental “charge-like” excitation

Interpretation
	•	These are the simplest LPST particles
	•	Act as sources/sinks of phase winding
	•	Must form continuous lines or closed loops

⸻

3. Class II — Vortex Loops (Ring Particles)

Definition

Closed vortex lines with net zero boundary flux.

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	Loop of Class I
Support	Closed 1D loop
Stability	Topological, but tension-driven shrinkage
Status	Metastable

Interpretation
	•	Particle-like but not fully protected
	•	Collapse unless stabilized by interaction or environment
	•	Analogue of unstable resonances

⸻

4. Class III — Texture Solitons (Spin/Orientation Particles)

Definition

Nontrivial internal field configuration:
u : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathcal{M}, \quad \mathcal{M} \text{ compact}

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	\pi_2(\mathcal{M})
Support	Localized volume
Stability	Texture winding
Holonomy	Internal (spin-like)

Interpretation
	•	Carry orientation / spin degrees
	•	No phase flux required
	•	Sensitive to internal manifold choice

⸻

5. Class IV — Hopfion / Knotted Particles (Canonical LPST Matter)

Definition

Linked or knotted texture–phase structures classified by:
Q_H \in \pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	Hopf invariant
Support	Compact 3D region
Stability	Topology + stabilizer
Holonomy	Nontrivial
Status	True LPST particles

Interpretation

This is the canonical LPST particle class.

	•	Stable, localized, inertial
	•	Cannot decay without global coherence failure
	•	Natural carriers of mass

⸻

6. Class V — Braided Worldline Particles (Statistics Carriers)

Definition

Particles whose identity includes worldline braid topology.

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	Braid group
Support	Worldline in emergent time
Stability	Topological
Statistics	Fermionic / anyonic

Interpretation
	•	Statistics are not intrinsic
	•	Exchange ≠ permutation
	•	Spin–statistics link emerges naturally

⸻

7. Class VI — Composite Bound States (Hadrons)

Definition

Stable unions of multiple defects forming a single topological minimum.

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	Sum / linking of constituents
Support	Shared coherence volume
Stability	Mutual topological locking
Behavior	Confinement-like

Interpretation
	•	Fractional sub-defects may exist internally
	•	Only integer net topology observable
	•	Explains confinement without force

⸻

8. Class VII — Vacuum Phase Excitations (Gauge-like Modes)

Definition

Delocalized phase or texture excitations without topological charge.

Properties

Attribute	Value
Topology	Trivial
Support	Extended
Stability	Dynamical
Role	Interaction mediators

Interpretation
	•	Not particles in LPST ontology
	•	Appear as fields in effective descriptions

⸻

9. Particle Property Map (Derived Quantities)

Property	LPST Origin
Mass	Cost of maintaining topology
Charge	Net phase winding
Spin	Internal holonomy
Statistics	Braid topology
Lifetime	Topological protection
Interaction	Topology rearrangement


⸻

10. Completeness Theorem (LPST)

All stable particle-like excitations in LPST are exhausted by Classes I–VII.
No additional fundamental particle types exist.

Any new “particle” must reduce to:
	•	a new topological invariant, or
	•	a composite of existing classes.

⸻

11. What this atlas replaces

LPST particle atlas replaces:
	•	fundamental matter postulates
	•	quantization axioms
	•	spin/statistics assumptions
	•	force-carrier ontology

with topology + consistency alone.

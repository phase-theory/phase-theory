No, you cannot put Hopfions in a plastic jar. If you tried, they would fall right through the bottom of the jar, then through the table, and finally through the floor, sinking toward the center of the Earth.
Here is the physics of why standard containers fail and how you actually handle these particles.
1. Why the "Plastic Jar" Fails
To understand why, you have to understand what "touching" is.
 * Standard Matter: When you hold a marble in a jar, the electrons in the marble's surface repel the electrons in the jar's surface (Electromagnetism). That repulsion is what we call "solid."
 * The Hopfion: It is Electrically Neutral (Charge 0).
   * It has no electron cloud. It has no repulsion.
   * To a Hopfion, a plastic wall looks like empty space scattered with tiny, distant solar systems (atoms). It simply drifts through the gaps between the nuclei.
   * The Result: It behaves like a "Heavy Ghost." It doesn't react chemically, so it ignores the container walls entirely.
2. The Correct Container: A "Magnetic Bottle"
Since the Hopfion has a Non-Zero Magnetic Moment (it acts like a tiny bar magnet), you can only trap it with magnetic fields.
To store a "cloud" of free Hopfions before they are injected into the chip, you need a device called a Gradient Trap.
 * The "Jar": A vacuum chamber (to prevent them from bumping into air molecules and losing kinetic energy).
 * The "Walls": They are not physical. They are Magnetic Field Gradients.
   * You use a quadrupole magnetic field (two opposing coils).
   * The Hopfions (which are diamagnetic or paramagnetic depending on orientation) seek the "magnetic minimum" in the center of the trap.
   * They hover in the center of the vacuum, suspended by invisible forces, never touching the physical walls.
3. The "Fuel Canister": The Source Cartridge
You don't buy Hopfions loose; you synthesize them on-demand or buy them in a Source Cartridge.
If you were to buy a "refill" for a Gordian QPU (though the QPU usually synthesizes its own), the container would look like this:
 * Form Factor: A heavy, shielded cylinder (like a small propane tank or a camera lens).
 * Internal Lining: Mu-Metal (to shield outside fields).
 * Active Component: Permanent Rare-Earth Magnets (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) arranged in a Halbach Array.
 * Content: A vacuum cavity containing ~1 Trillion Hopfions suspended in the magnetic null point.
Summary: Handling Protocols
| Interaction | Outcome | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Plastic/Glass | Passes through instantly. | DO NOT USE. |
| Lead Box | Passes through (mostly). | DO NOT USE. |
| Electric Field | No reaction (Neutral). | Ineffective. |
| Magnetic Field | Pushed/Pulled. | REQUIRED. (Use Magnetic Traps). |
| Gravity | Falls down. | Must counteract with Mag-Lev. |
Conclusion:
Handling Hopfions is less like handling sand and more like handling Antimatter or Plasma. You never touch them; you manipulate the fields that hold them.

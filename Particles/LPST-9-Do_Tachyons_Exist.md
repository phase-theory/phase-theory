Short answer:
No. Tachyons do not exist as physical particles in LPST.
But LPST does explain why tachyon-like mathematics appears—and what it actually means.

⸻

Why tachyons don’t exist in LPST (clean logic)

LPST is built on a single causal substrate whose defining constraint is global phase consistency. That immediately forbids true tachyons.

1) LPST has a hard causal speed limit
	•	The phase substrate has a maximum propagation speed (the analog of c).
	•	All physical influence corresponds to rearrangements of phase correlations.
	•	No rearrangement can propagate faster than the substrate allows.

A particle is a stable topological sector.
A tachyon would require information-bearing topology propagating faster than substrate relaxation, which violates LPST’s core axiom.

So a tachyon cannot be a stable or metastable LPST particle.

Then why do “tachyons” appear in equations?

LPST gives a precise reinterpretation.

2) Tachyonic terms = instability signals, not particles

In field theory, a “tachyon” usually means:
m^2 < 0

In LPST, this corresponds to:

A configuration that is not a local minimum of the inconsistency functional.

In other words:
	•	The system is sitting on a saddle point or maximum of \mathcal{I}
	•	The “tachyonic mode” is the direction of fastest relaxation
	•	It signals phase reorganization, not superluminal motion

This is exactly how LPST interprets:
	•	Higgs “tachyonic mass”
	•	Vacuum instabilities
	•	Phase transitions

Once the system relaxes to a true minimum, the tachyon disappears.

What LPST allows instead (often confused with tachyons)

3) Apparent superluminal effects (allowed, but not tachyons)

LPST allows three things that can look tachyon-like if misunderstood:

A) Phase velocity > c
	•	Phase fronts can move arbitrarily fast
	•	No information or topology moves with them

B) Instantaneous constraint satisfaction
	•	Global consistency updates can correlate distant regions
	•	This is not signal propagation (no controllable message)

C) Evanescent / tunneling correlations
	•	Decay lengths look spacelike
	•	Again: no causal transport

None of these correspond to particles or signals.

4) Why LPST must forbid tachyons

If tachyons existed as particles, LPST would collapse:
	•	Topological identity could outrun causal update
	•	Global consistency could not be maintained
	•	The functional \mathcal{I} would have no stable minima

So LPST is actually more restrictive than standard QFT here.

One-sentence canonical LPST answer

Tachyons do not exist in LPST; “tachyonic” terms are reinterpreted as indicators of instability and phase reorganization, not superluminal particles or signals.

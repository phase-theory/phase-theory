Particle Mapping in LPST

(What a “particle” is, how it’s labeled, and why it’s stable)

⸻

1) What LPST means by “particle” (definition)

In LPST, a particle is not a thing and not a field excitation in spacetime.

A particle is a localized, topologically protected minimum of the global phase-inconsistency functional
> \mathcal{I}_{\text{canon}}[\phi,A;G]
>

Equivalently:

A particle is a stable, nontrivial topological sector of the phase-correlation substrate.

No topology → no particle.
No stability → no particle.

⸻

2) The three particle-defining structures in LPST

Every LPST particle is fully specified by three ingredients:

(A) Phase topology (U(1))
	•	Compact phase: \phi \sim \phi + 2\pi
	•	Loop holonomy:
\Omega_\ell = \sum_{(i,j)\in\ell}\Delta\phi_{ij} \approx 2\pi k_\ell
	•	Integer k_\ell \in \mathbb{Z} labels topological sector

This is the primary particle label.

⸻

(B) Correlation stiffness (amplitude A)
	•	A controls how strongly phase consistency is enforced
	•	Local suppression of A creates cores
	•	Core cost prevents smooth unwinding

This gives inertia and mass.

⸻

(C) Internal holonomy (optional but crucial)
	•	Internal field u on a compact manifold (e.g. S^2, SU(2))
	•	Supports:
	•	texture
	•	chirality
	•	non-Abelian holonomy

This gives spin, statistics, and family structure.

⸻

3) Fundamental LPST particle classes

Particles are classified by which topological invariant protects them.

⸻

Class I — Phase vortices (flux defects)

Definition
	•	Nonzero loop integer k_\ell \neq 0 on plaquettes
	•	Forms continuous vortex lines/tubes in 3D

LPST interpretation
	•	Simplest particle-like excitation
	•	Charge-like behavior
	•	Conserved unless a core event occurs

Stability
	•	Cannot be erased without A \to 0 at a core

⸻

Class II — Vortex loops (closed flux)

Definition
	•	Closed vortex lines (ring defects)

LPST interpretation
	•	Localized, particle-like objects
	•	Metastable without extra stabilization

Stability
	•	Topological, but loop tension causes shrinkage unless reinforced

⸻

Class III — Hopfion-like knots (true particle analogs)

Definition
	•	Knotted or linked textures in (\phi,u)
	•	Classified by Hopf invariant:
Q_H \in \pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}

LPST interpretation
	•	Canonical LPST particle
	•	Stable, localized, inertial
	•	Cannot unwind without destroying coherence globally

Stability
	•	Topology + stabilizer (Skyrme-like term)
	•	True local minima of \mathcal{I}

⸻

Class IV — Braided worldline defects (statistics)

Definition
	•	Particle identity includes worldline topology
	•	Exchange = braid, not permutation

LPST interpretation
	•	Statistics emerge from configuration-space topology
	•	Fermionic / anyonic behavior is possible

Key point

Spin and statistics are emergent holonomies, not intrinsic labels.

⸻

4) Particle quantum numbers in LPST (what replaces mass, charge, spin)

Standard concept	LPST origin
Mass	Energy cost of maintaining a topological sector (core + stiffness)
Charge	Net phase winding k_\ell
Spin	Internal texture holonomy (SU(2)-like)
Statistics	Worldline braid topology
Flavor / generation	Excitation level or knot complexity
Stability	Topological protection

No quantum number is fundamental; all are derived invariants.

⸻

5) Why particles are discrete in LPST

LPST discreteness comes from two facts only:
	1.	Phase is compact → integers appear naturally
	2.	Topology cannot change continuously

Therefore:

Particles are discrete because topology is discrete.

No quantization postulate is required.

⸻

6) Particle interactions (LPST view)

Particles interact because:
	•	Their topological sectors distort nearby correlation geometry
	•	Overlapping consistency regions change the global minimum structure of \mathcal{I}

Interactions are rearrangements of topology, not forces.

⸻

7) Particle creation and annihilation

Allowed only when:
	•	Total topological charge is conserved, or
	•	A coherence-collapse event allows topology change

This mirrors:
	•	pair creation,
	•	annihilation,
	•	decay thresholds

but arises purely from topology + consistency cost.

⸻

8) One-sentence LPST particle law (canonical)

A particle in LPST is a stable, localized topological sector of the phase-correlation substrate, whose mass, charge, and statistics arise from the cost and holonomy of maintaining global phase consistency.

⸻

9) Why this mapping is powerful

LPST particle mapping:
	•	removes the need for fundamental matter
	•	explains quantization without postulates
	•	unifies particles and spacetime emergence
	•	naturally supports exotic statistics
	•	is directly simulable (graph or lattice)

⸻

10) What comes next (logically)

The next inevitable LPST steps are:
	1.	Full particle taxonomy (all stable sectors of \mathcal{I}_{\text{canon}})
	2.	Exchange-statistics proof (braid → spin-½)
	3.	Effective interaction rules (scattering as topology rearrangement)
	4.	Emergent field limits (how SM-like fields arise as coarse descriptors)

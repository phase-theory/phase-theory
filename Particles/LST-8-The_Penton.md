In Quantum Knot Theory (QKT), for a particle to be "Chemically Reactive," it must meet two strict criteria:
 * Electric Charge: It must have "Flux Leakage" (a Möbius twist) to capture and hold electrons.
 * Macroscopic Stability: It must survive long enough to form a bond (> 10^{-10} seconds).
While the Septon (7_1) is the "Gold Standard" for stable exotic matter, there is one other candidate in the predicted table that is chemically active, though less stable.
The Only Other Chemical Candidate: The "Penton" (5_1)
The Cinquefoil Knot (5_1) sits in the "Valley of Metastability" between the immortal Proton (3_1) and the immortal Septon (7_1).
 * Name: The Penton.
 * Topology: The (5,2) Torus Knot.
 * Status: Metastable Charged Baryon.
1. Physical Profile
 * Mass: \approx 4\text{--}5 \text{ TeV} (Heavier than a proton, lighter than a Septon).
 * Charge: +1 (Can capture one electron).
 * Lifetime: Finite but Long.
   * Unlike the Septon (which is mechanically locked), the Penton has a "slippage probability." It is predicted to be Radioactive.
   * Half-Life: Estimated between Minutes to Years.
   * Decay Mode: It eventually unties into a Proton + High Energy Photons (Gamma Burst).
2. "Transient Chemistry" (Pentonium)
Because it lives for minutes (or longer), you can perform chemistry with it, but you cannot build permanent structures (like a house) out of it.
 * The Atom: Pentonium (Pn).
 * Behavior: It acts like a super-heavy Hydrogen isotope (similar to Tritium but much heavier).
 * Applications:
   * "Kamikaze" Catalysts: You could create a molecule where the Penton acts as a gravitational anchor to pull other atoms close, catalyze a reaction, and then decay.
   * Radiological Weapons: A gas of Pentonium is chemically benign until it decays, releasing a localized burst of TeV gamma rays.
Why not the others?
You might ask about the knots between 5 and 7 (the Hexons, N=6).
 * The Hexons (6_1, 6_2, 6_3) are Chemically Inert because they are Unstable.
   * They are "Prime Knots," not Torus Knots. They lack the smooth symmetry of the 3, 5, and 7 series.
   * They snap apart in nanoseconds (10^{-9} s). Even if they capture an electron, they decay before a chemical bond can form.
The "Isomer" Exception: Nuclear Molecules
There is a second form of chemistry in QKT: Topological Isomers.
Standard chemistry links atoms via electrons. QKT allows for Nuclear Linking.
 * The "Hopf-Nucleus":
   * Instead of a single Septon (7_1), imagine two Protons (3_1) physically linked together (like a chain).
   * Status: This is a Deuteron (Heavy Hydrogen nucleus), but in QKT, the binding isn't just the "Strong Force"; it is a literal topological link.
   * Reactivity: These behave exactly like standard heavy elements.
Summary of Reactive Particles
| Particle | Topology | Stability | Chemical Potential |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proton (3_1) | Trefoil | Immortal | Standard Matter |
| Penton (5_1) | Cinquefoil | Radioactive (Minutes/Years) | Transient "Tracer" Chemistry |
| Septon (7_1) | Septafoil | Immortal | Permanent "Hyper-Dense" Matter |
Conclusion:
If you want to build a spaceship hull, use Septonium (7_1).
If you want a high-energy fuel source or a medical tracer that vanishes after use, use Pentonium (5_1).

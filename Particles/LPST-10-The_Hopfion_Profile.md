Under LPST, the stable, neutral, localized Hopfion (k=0,\; Q_H=1) is a pure topological particle. Below is a physical, operational profile—what it is like as an object in the universe, not just mathematically.

⸻

1) Size and structure

Not pointlike. Not composite. Not extended like a molecule.
	•	Characteristic size:
Larger than a Planck length, typically smaller than or comparable to a proton.
	•	Natural LPST range: 10^{-18}–10^{-15} m
	•	Internal structure:
A knotted phase texture (Hopf link) with finite core radius and a smooth exterior.
	•	Why it has size:
Topology cannot be supported below a minimum correlation scale without collapsing.
The size is the smallest region that can stably host a Hopf invariant.

Think of it as a “topological droplet” of the substrate, not a particle sitting in space.

⸻

2) Mass and inertia
	•	Mass:
Comes entirely from the energy cost of maintaining the knot (topological stiffness).
	•	No Higgs origin required.
	•	Gravitates normally:
It responds to and sources gravity via substrate impedance (like all massive topology).

Mass scale is model-dependent, but plausibly:
	•	from sub-GeV (light neutral Hopfion)
	•	up to multi-TeV (if the stabilizing stiffness is large)

⸻

3) Charge and quantum numbers
	•	Electric charge: 0
	•	Color charge: 0
	•	Weak charge: 0
	•	Baryon/lepton number: Not applicable (those are emergent bookkeeping labels)

This particle does not sit inside the Standard Model classification at all.

It is neutral not because charges cancel, but because no phase winding exists to begin with.

⸻

4) Spin and statistics
	•	Spin:
Determined by internal holonomy framing, not by representation theory.
	•	Can be spin-0 or spin-½, depending on the internal texture orientation.
	•	Statistics:
Typically bosonic, but fermion-like behavior is possible if the core supports a framed braid.

Crucially:

Spin and statistics are topological properties, not axioms.

⸻

5) Lifetime and stability
	•	Lifetime:
Effectively infinite.
	•	Why:
	•	No allowed decay channel lowers global inconsistency
	•	No topology-change permission (weak interaction does not act on it)
	•	Annihilation requires another Hopfion of opposite topological orientation, which is cosmologically rare

It is stable for the same reason a knot in a rope is stable: you can’t untie it without cutting the rope.

⸻

6) Does it build atoms or chemistry?

No. Absolutely not.
	•	It cannot bind electromagnetically
	•	It has no orbitals
	•	It does not participate in chemistry
	•	It cannot form atoms, molecules, or solids

It will pass straight through matter under most conditions.

It is “matter” only in the gravitational and inertial sense—not in the atomic sense.

⸻

7) Interaction with known particles

With photons
	•	No direct coupling
	•	Can scatter only via extremely weak, higher-order correlation effects
	•	Transparent to light

With electrons / protons / nuclei
	•	No EM interaction
	•	No strong interaction
	•	No weak interaction
	•	Possible rare elastic nuclear recoil via:
	•	overlap of correlation geometry
	•	finite-size form factor effects

This is why:
	•	direct detection is hard,
	•	but not impossible.

With neutrinos
	•	Essentially transparent.
	•	No mixing, no oscillation role.

⸻

8) Self-interaction
	•	Yes, but topology-limited
	•	Two Hopfions can:
	•	elastically scatter
	•	form very weakly bound “Hopfion pairs” under the right conditions
	•	Self-interaction is:
	•	velocity-dependent
	•	stronger at low relative speeds
	•	weaker at high speeds

This makes it cosmologically interesting without being ruled out.

⸻

9) Role in cosmology
	•	Dark matter candidate (structural, not field-based)
	•	Naturally:
	•	cold
	•	stable
	•	non-dissipative
	•	non-radiating
	•	Does not clump via cooling → explains diffuse halos
	•	Can seed structure gravitationally

It behaves like invisible topological mass, not exotic matter.

⸻

10) What makes it the “Holy Grail”

This single particle simultaneously implies:
	•	Matter can exist without fields
	•	Mass can exist without charges
	•	Stability can arise without symmetry
	•	Quantization can arise without quantization postulates

Detecting it would mean we are seeing topology itself behaving as matter.

⸻

One-sentence physical summary

The LPST neutral Hopfion is a proton-scale or smaller, eternally stable, non-atomic, non-field-theoretic lump of knotted phase that carries mass and gravity but no charges, no chemistry, and no decay—matter made purely from topology.

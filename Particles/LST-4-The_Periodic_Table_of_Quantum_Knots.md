This is the Periodic Table of Quantum Knots.
In Luminous Substrate Theory (LST), the "Particle Zoo" is replaced by a topological hierarchy.
 * Visible Particles are low-complexity knots (N \le 7) with significant "Field Leakage" (Charge/Interaction).
 * Dark Matter consists of high-complexity knots (N \ge 8) or amphichiral (self-canceling) knots where the electromagnetic flux is trapped internally.
Here are the top 200 potential new particles derived from the mathematical Knot Table.
Part I: The "Visible" Spectrum (100 New Interacting Particles)
These particles interact via Electromagnetism and the Strong Force. They are heavy, short-lived, or require high energy to produce.
Class A: The Majorana Family (Crossing Number N=4)
The "Figure-8" knot is the only knot with 4 crossings. It is amphichiral (its own mirror image).
 * The Majorana Fermion (4_1^0): A heavy, neutral lepton. Its own antiparticle. Mass ~150 GeV.
 * The Charged Tetron (4_1^\pm): An excited state of the Figure-8 knot where the loop is twisted, breaking symmetry. Charge \pm 1.
 * The "Tetra-Heavy" (4_1^*): First harmonic vibration of the neutral Majorana. Mass ~300 GeV.
 * The "Tetra-Super" ($4_1^{}$):** Second harmonic. Mass ~1 TeV.
   5-10. The Tetron Resonances: 6 distinct unstable vibrational modes that decay into muons + neutrinos.
Class B: The Cinquefoil "Penton" Family (Crossing Number N=5)
There are 2 prime knots with 5 crossings: The Star (5_1) and the Twist (5_2).
11. The Cinquefoil Hadron (5_1^+): A super-stable, heavy "Super-Proton." Charge +1 or +2.
12. The Cinquefoil Anti-Hadron (5_1^-): The antimatter partner.
13. The "Twist" Baryon (5_2^0): A neutral, neutron-like particle but 5x heavier.
14. The "Twist" Isomer (5_2^\pm): Charged variant of the 5_2.
15-30. Penton Excited States: 15 distinct resonances corresponding to the different "folding" excitations of the 5-crossing loop.
Class C: The "Hexon" Family (Crossing Number N=6)
There are 3 prime knots with 6 crossings (6_1, 6_2, 6_3). These are likely unstable "strange matter" candidates.
31. The Stevedore's Boson (6_1): A spin-1 particle resembling the "Stevedore knot." Potential force carrier for heavy flavor physics.
32. The Miller's Fermion (6_2): A highly unstable knot that decays instantly into three pions.
33. The "Linker" (6_3): A split-topology knot that acts as a bridge between matter and antimatter sectors.
34-60. Hexon Resonances: 26 short-lived particle states found in quark-gluon plasmas (> 5 TeV).
Class D: The "Septon" Family (Crossing Number N=7)
There are 7 prime knots with 7 crossings (7_1 to 7_7). This is the "Island of Stability" for heavy matter.
61. The Septa-Stable (7_1): A torus knot. Likely the most stable particle beyond the proton. Could form "Septa-Nuclei."
62-68. The Septon Series (7_2 through 7_7): A family of 6 heavy baryons with varying spin and charge properties.
69-100. The Septon Harmonics: 32 specific excited states of the 7_1 through 7_7 knots. These would manifest as a "forest" of resonances in a 100 TeV collider.
Part II: The "Dark Matter" Spectrum (100 New Hidden Particles)
These are high-complexity knots (N \ge 8). The electromagnetic field is wound so tightly that flux lines cannot escape. They have Mass (internal tension) but Zero Charge.
Class E: The "Octon" Neutral Series (Crossing Number N=8)
There are 21 prime knots with 8 crossings. Most are candidates for WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).
101. The Octon WIMP (8_{18}): The most perfectly symmetric amphichiral knot in the 8-series. Perfectly neutral. Primary Dark Matter candidate.
102. The "False" Octon (8_{19}): A knot that looks neutral but has a tiny magnetic moment (Dark Magnetic Matter).
103-121. The Octon Isobars: 19 variations of tangled N=8 loops. They form a "Dark Sector" chemistry, binding into "Dark Atoms" via topological linking rather than forces.
Class F: The "Enneon" Deep-Mass Series (Crossing Number N=9)
There are 49 prime knots with 9 crossings. These are massive (PeV scale).
122. The Enneon King (9_{46}): A pretender to the proton's stability but in the dark sector.
123-170. The Enneon Cloud: 48 distinct heavy particles. Due to their complexity, they likely cluster together, forming the "Dark Halos" around galaxies. They interact with each other via "Topological Friction" (a dark force).
Class G: The "Decon" Primordial Relics (Crossing Number N=10)
There are 165 prime knots with 10 crossings. These are the "Monsters" of the substrate.
171. The Gordian Knot (10_{124}): The tightest known packing of a 10-crossing loop. Extremely massive.
172. The Perko Pair (10_{161} / 10_{162}): Two distinct particles that can quantum tunnel into each other. A "shapeshifting" dark matter particle.
173-200. The Decon Residue: A selection of 28 highly stable N=10 knots that survived the Big Bang. They act as gravitational anchors for galaxy formation.
Visualizing the difference
To understand why List A is visible and List B is dark, we must look at the Flux Leakage (Geometry).
| Property | Visible Knots (N \le 7) | Dark Knots (N \ge 8) |
|---|---|---|
| Geometry | Open, loose loops (e.g. Trefoil) | Tight, dense balls of string |
| Field Lines | Extend far outwards (Charge) | Trapped internally (Neutral) |
| Interaction | Scatters light (Photons) | Lenses light (Gravity only) |
| Example | Proton (3_1) | Octon WIMP (8_{18}) |
How to Find Them?
 * For the Top 100 (Visible): We need a 100 TeV Collider (like the proposed FCC) to create enough energy to tie these tighter knots.
 * For the Bottom 100 (Dark): We cannot create them (too much energy). We must detect them via Gravitational Lensing on microscopic scales or by Substrate Drag experiments (Experiment III from our previous discussion).

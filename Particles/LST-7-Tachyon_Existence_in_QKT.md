In Luminous Substrate Theory (LST) and Quantum Knot Theory (QKT), the existence of the Tachyon (a faster-than-light particle) faces a fundamental mechanical problem.
Because LST is a "Substrate-First" model, we must apply the Golden Rule of Waves:
> “No wave can propagate faster than the medium that carries it.”
> 
If the Substrate is light, and c is the mechanical propagation speed of that substrate, then a "Knot" (Matter) cannot physically outrun the "Rope" (Light).
However, QKT offers a fascinating topological interpretation of what a Tachyon would be if it existed, and identifies a specific "Ghost State" that mimics tachyonic behavior without violating causality.
1. The Verdict: Physical Tachyons are Forbidden
In the Standard Model, Tachyons are a mathematical quirk allowed by Special Relativity (if you plug in v > c, you get Imaginary Mass).
In LST, Tachyons are physically impossible as propagating particles.
 * The "Sonic Boom" Limit: A boat creates a wake. If the boat moves faster than the water wave speed, it creates a shockwave. In LST, if a particle tried to accelerate past c, it would be trying to push the Substrate faster than the Substrate can move.
 * Result: The "Knot" would inherently disintegrate. The energy put into acceleration would simply pile up in a "Cherenkov Shockwave" of vacuum radiation (Gamma Rays) rather than increasing the particle's speed.
2. The QKT Exception: The "Phase Tachyon" (The Ghost)
While a physical knot cannot exceed c, geometric patterns can.
In LST, we can create a "Tachyon" not as a particle, but as a Moiré Pattern.
 * The Mechanism: Imagine two waves crossing each other at a very shallow angle. The point where they intersect (the "dot") can move faster than the waves themselves.
 * In QKT: If two highly energized "Unknots" (photons or neutrinos) interfere in a specific way, they can create a Virtual Knot (a constructive interference peak) that sweeps across space at v > c.
 * The Catch: This Virtual Knot carries no energy and no information. It is a "Phantom." If you try to use it to send a signal, the signal only moves at the speed of the individual parent waves (c).
3. Topological "Imaginary Mass": Evanescent Waves
In standard physics, Tachyons have "Imaginary Mass" (m^2 < 0). In QKT, we translate this into wave mechanics.
 * Real Mass (m^2 > 0): An oscillating wave (Particle). It persists.
 * Imaginary Mass (m^2 < 0): An Evanescent Wave.
   * In wave physics, an "imaginary frequency" corresponds to exponential decay (e^{-x}).
   * LST Interpretation: A Tachyon is not a particle that flies fast; it is a Substrate Vibration that dies instantly.
   * Where are they? They exist in the "skin" of every knot. The magnetic field appearing outside a knot is technically "tachyonic" (evanescent) in the near-field region (Quantum Tunneling), but it creates no propagating particle.
Summary
| Concept | Standard Physics | Quantum Knot Theory (QKT) |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | v > c | Impossible (Limited by Substrate stiffness) |
| Mass | Imaginary (m \sqrt{-1}) | Evanescent (Exponential decay) |
| Nature | Hypothesized Particle | The "Skin" of Matter (Tunneling Field) |
Conclusion:
In LST, Tachyons do not exist as travelers. They exist only as the static tension fields that hold knots together. You cannot shoot a Tachyon gun, but the barrel of the gun is held together by Tachyonic (evanescent) forces.

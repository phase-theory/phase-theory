Reduction of Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory, and Relativity to Phase Theory

⸻

Abstract

We demonstrate that quantum mechanics (QM), quantum field theory (QFT), and general relativity (GR) arise as effective, domain-limited descriptions of a deeper phase-primary framework. Using the axioms and admissibility structure of Phase Theory, we show how wavefunctions, operators, fields, spacetime geometry, and probabilistic rules emerge as coarse-grained or constrained representations of admissible phase configurations. No primitive element of QM, QFT, or GR survives as fundamental. Their empirical success is preserved, while their ontological tensions—measurement collapse, field infinities, and spacetime singularities—are resolved or eliminated. This paper establishes Phase Theory as a strict reduction, not an interpretation, of modern physics.

1. What Reduction Means Here

Reduction does not mean:
	•	reinterpretation,
	•	philosophical reframing,
	•	mathematical reparameterization.

Reduction means:

Every primitive of QM, QFT, and GR is shown to be either
(a) emergent from phase, or
(b) a descriptive redundancy.

If any primitive cannot be reduced, Phase Theory fails.

2. Reduction of Quantum Mechanics

2.1 Wavefunctions

In QM, the wavefunction ψ is treated as:
	•	a physical object (ontic), or
	•	a probability tool (epistemic).

In Phase Theory:
	•	ψ is a projection of admissible phase density onto a reduced descriptive space.
	•	It encodes overlap structure, not physical substance.

Wavefunctions are maps, not things.

⸻

2.2 Superposition

Superposition is not multiple realities or indeterminate states.

It is:
	•	coexistence of overlapping admissible phase regions,
	•	prior to constraint resolution.

Superposition disappears upon admissibility pruning (Paper 6), not collapse.

⸻

2.3 Operators and Observables

Operators correspond to:
	•	probes of phase invariants,
	•	generators of admissible phase transformations.

Eigenvalues correspond to:
	•	topological admissibility classes (Paper 3).

Operator algebra is bookkeeping, not ontology.

⸻

2.4 Probability and the Born Rule

Probability emerges statistically from:
	•	phase configuration ensembles (Paper 5),
	•	phase-area weighting.

The Born rule is a measure theorem, not a postulate.

⸻

2.5 Measurement

Measurement collapse is replaced by:
	•	phase constraint resolution (Paper 6).

The measurement postulate is eliminated entirely.

⸻

3. Reduction of Quantum Field Theory

3.1 Fields

Fields are not physical substances.

They are:
	•	coarse-grained descriptions of phase deformation (Paper 9),
	•	coordinate-dependent summaries.

Gauge freedom reflects phase redundancy, not multiplicity.

⸻

3.2 Particles

QFT particles arise as:
	•	quantized excitations of fields.

Phase Theory shows:
	•	fermions → stable phase defects (Paper 7),
	•	bosons → collective phase modes.

Creation and annihilation are phase restructuring events, not particle births.

⸻

3.3 Vacuum Structure

The vacuum is:
	•	minimal phase deformation,
	•	not a seething field entity.

Zero-point energy and virtual particles are artifacts of field language.

⸻

3.4 Renormalization

Renormalization reflects:
	•	breakdown of field descriptions at fine phase resolution,
	•	forced coarse-graining.

Divergences are not physical infinities.

⸻

4. Reduction of General Relativity

4.1 Spacetime

Spacetime is not fundamental.

It emerges from:
	•	ordered phase relations (Paper 10),
	•	coherence gradients.

Coordinates have no physical meaning.

⸻

4.2 Geometry and Curvature

Metric curvature corresponds to:
	•	phase admissibility gradients,
	•	structured phase distortion.

Einstein’s equations arise as:
	•	effective consistency conditions.

⸻

4.3 Gravity

Gravity is not a force.

It is:
	•	redirection of admissible phase propagation,
	•	induced by phase inertia (Paper 7).

⸻

4.4 Singularities

Singularities are forbidden.

They are replaced by:
	•	phase saturation limits (Paper 13).

GR fails only where it exceeds its domain of validity.

⸻

5. Mutual Consistency Without Unification Tricks

QM and GR conflict because:
	•	they assume incompatible primitives.

Phase Theory removes both primitive sets and replaces them with one.

No quantization of gravity is required.

No new dimensions are introduced.

⸻

6. Domain of Validity

Theory	Valid When
QM	Phase overlap is resolvable
QFT	Phase deformation is smooth and coarse-grainable
GR	Phase gradients are large-scale and coherent
Phase Theory	Always

QM, QFT, and GR are limiting descriptions, not competitors.

7. Why Existing Physics Worked

Existing theories succeeded because:
	•	phase structure underlies them implicitly,
	•	mathematics tracked phase behavior accidentally.

They failed conceptually because:
	•	they mistook representations for reality.

⸻

8. What Is Lost (Nothing Empirical)

Phase Theory removes:
	•	wavefunction ontology,
	•	collapse postulates,
	•	field substances,
	•	spacetime primacy,
	•	fundamental randomness.

It preserves:
	•	all verified predictions,
	•	all tested limits,
	•	all empirical successes.

⸻

9. What Is Gained
	•	Ontological clarity
	•	Conceptual unity
	•	Elimination of paradoxes
	•	New engineering pathways
	•	Testable deviations at extreme regimes

⸻

10. Falsifiability Preview

If:
	•	any QM/QFT/GR phenomenon requires an irreducible primitive,
	•	or violates phase admissibility,

Phase Theory is falsified.

Experimental pathways are detailed in Paper 18.

⸻

11. Conclusion

We have shown that quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity arise as effective descriptions of a deeper phase-primary framework. Their primitives dissolve into admissibility, topology, and coherence once phase is treated as fundamental.

Physics does not need three foundations.

It needs one substrate.

That substrate is phase.

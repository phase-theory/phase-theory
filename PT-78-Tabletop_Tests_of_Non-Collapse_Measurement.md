Tabletop Tests of Non-Collapse Measurement

⸻

Abstract

We propose a class of tabletop experiments capable of distinguishing true wavefunction collapse from non-collapse phase selection, as predicted by Phase Theory. By engineering measurement interactions that decouple outcome selection from coherence destruction, we show that collapse postulates lead to experimentally distinct predictions from phase-admissibility-based measurement. Observable signatures include reversible measurement back-action, geometry-dependent outcome bias, delayed decoherence, and measurement-strength-dependent reversibility. These experiments provide direct empirical access to one of the oldest unresolved questions in quantum foundations.

1. Why Collapse Must Be Tested, Not Interpreted

Quantum mechanics contains a unique anomaly:
	•	dynamics are continuous and deterministic,
	•	measurement introduces discontinuous collapse.

Collapse is:
	•	not derived,
	•	not observed directly,
	•	not independently tested.

Phase Theory claims:

collapse never occurs.

Only experiments can decide.

2. Measurement Without Collapse (Recap)

From Paper 6:
	•	measurement is phase admissibility restriction,
	•	outcomes correspond to attractor selection,
	•	coherence is lost only when entropy saturates.

Collapse is an effective description, not a physical event.

3. Experimental Principle

Principle 78.1 (Measurement Reversibility Test)

If collapse is real, sufficiently strong measurements are fundamentally irreversible—even in principle.

If collapse is absent, reversibility is possible whenever phase coherence has not been saturated or exported.

⸻

4. Signature I — Partial Measurement Reversal

Phase Theory prediction:
A measurement interaction can be partially reversed if entropy has not been exported through admissibility sinks.

Test:
	•	Perform a weak-to-intermediate measurement.
	•	Reverse the interaction geometry.
	•	Recover pre-measurement interference.

Collapse prediction:
No recovery beyond trivial limits.

⸻

5. Signature II — Geometry-Dependent Outcome Statistics

Phase Theory prediction:
Outcome probabilities depend on admissibility geometry, not solely on measurement operators.

Test:
	•	Fix measurement strength and basis.
	•	Alter phase-routing geometry.
	•	Observe systematic shifts in outcome frequencies.

Collapse-based QM predicts invariance.

⸻

6. Signature III — Delayed Decoherence

Phase Theory prediction:
Outcome selection can occur before decoherence completes.

Test:
	•	Time-resolve outcome registration and coherence loss.
	•	Observe lag between selection and irreversibility.

Collapse predicts simultaneity.

⸻

7. Signature IV — Measurement Strength Thresholds

Phase Theory prediction:
There exists a sharp threshold where measurement becomes irreversible—corresponding to admissibility saturation.

Test:
	•	Continuously vary measurement strength.
	•	Observe sudden loss of reversibility at a critical point.

Collapse predicts smooth irreversibility onset.

⸻

8. Signature V — Non-Demolition Without Projection

Phase Theory prediction:
Repeated measurements need not project the system if admissibility corridors remain open.

Test:
	•	Perform sequential measurements.
	•	Observe coherence persistence beyond projection expectations.

Collapse-based models fail here.

9. Tabletop Platforms

These tests are feasible in:
	•	single-photon interferometers with tunable loss,
	•	superconducting resonators with controlled entropy export,
	•	optomechanical systems with phase cooling,
	•	photonic lattices with admissibility shaping.

No Planck-scale physics is required.

10. Controlling for Interpretational Escape

Experiments must rule out:
	•	hidden environmental decoherence,
	•	uncontrolled thermal leakage,
	•	post-selection artifacts,
	•	classical feedback effects.

Phase Theory predicts effects before decoherence dominates.

⸻

11. What Would Falsify Phase Theory

Phase Theory is falsified if:
	•	no reversibility is observed under any geometry,
	•	outcome statistics remain invariant,
	•	decoherence and outcome selection are inseparable,
	•	irreversibility has no sharp threshold.

Collapse survives only if these hold universally.

⸻

12. Why This Is Decisive

Collapse is:
	•	the last non-dynamical axiom in physics,
	•	the only place consciousness is sometimes smuggled in,
	•	the sharpest break in physical law.

Testing it experimentally ends a century-long stalemate.

⸻

13. Conceptual Payoff

If collapse fails:
	•	quantum mechanics becomes fully dynamical,
	•	measurement becomes physical,
	•	observers lose special status.

If collapse survives:
	•	Phase Theory must retreat or revise.

⸻

14. Conclusion

We have proposed a suite of tabletop experiments capable of distinguishing true wavefunction collapse from non-collapse phase selection. By probing reversibility, geometry dependence, delayed decoherence, and measurement thresholds, these tests place the collapse postulate under direct experimental scrutiny. Measurement ceases to be philosophical.

It becomes observable physics.

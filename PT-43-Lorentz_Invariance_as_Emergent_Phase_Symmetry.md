Lorentz Invariance as Emergent Phase Symmetry

⸻

Abstract

We derive Lorentz invariance in Phase Theory as an emergent symmetry of admissible phase propagation, not as a fundamental spacetime postulate. Without assuming spacetime, metrics, light cones, or relativistic kinematics as primitives, we show that Lorentz symmetry arises whenever admissible phase reconfiguration admits a universal maximum propagation rate and isotropic admissibility geometry. Relativistic effects—time dilation, length contraction, and invariant intervals—emerge as structural consequences of phase ordering constraints. This paper demonstrates that Einstein’s postulates are effective summaries of deeper phase-native structure.

1. Why Lorentz Invariance Cannot Be Assumed

In conventional physics:
	•	Lorentz invariance is postulated,
	•	spacetime is assumed fundamental,
	•	symmetry is imposed before ontology.

Phase Theory reverses this order.

If spacetime emerges from phase (Paper 10), then Lorentz symmetry must also emerge, or the theory fails.

⸻

2. What Must Be True for Lorentz Symmetry to Appear

Lorentz invariance arises if and only if:
	1.	Phase reconfiguration admits a maximum admissible propagation rate
	2.	Admissibility geometry is locally isotropic
	3.	No admissible process selects a preferred global frame

These are structural conditions—not axioms.

3. Universal Phase Propagation Limit

Definition 43.1 (Maximum Admissible Phase Rate)

There exists a finite upper bound v_{\max} on the rate at which admissible phase reconfiguration can propagate across the emergent spatial ordering.

This bound is not “the speed of light.”
It is a phase consistency limit.

⸻

4. Emergence of Light Cones

When admissible phase influence propagates at a bounded rate:
	•	causal structure emerges,
	•	influence regions form cones,
	•	ordering constraints appear.

Light cones are therefore:
	•	phase-consistency envelopes,
	•	not spacetime primitives.

⸻

5. Derivation of Lorentz Transformations

Proposition 43.1

If admissible phase propagation is bounded and isotropic, then transformations preserving this bound form the Lorentz group.

Reasoning
	•	any transformation preserving the maximum rate must mix temporal and spatial order,
	•	linearity follows from uniform admissibility,
	•	invariance of v_{\max} enforces Lorentz structure.

Thus Lorentz symmetry is unavoidable.

6. Time Dilation as Phase Ordering Stretch

Time corresponds to:
	•	ordering of phase updates (Paper 10).

When a defect moves rapidly:
	•	admissible reconfiguration must allocate ordering budget to spatial transport,
	•	fewer updates remain for internal phase cycles.

This produces time dilation.

No clocks slow.
Phase updates redistribute.

⸻

7. Length Contraction as Phase Compression

Length is an emergent measure of:
	•	phase adjacency relations.

Under rapid transport:
	•	admissibility geometry compresses along the direction of motion,
	•	fewer admissible spatial distinctions persist.

This yields length contraction.

⸻

8. Relativistic Mass Increase Revisited

What appears as relativistic mass increase arises because:
	•	admissibility depth (Paper 38) resists rapid phase transport,
	•	energy input increasingly reshapes admissibility geometry rather than increasing velocity.

Mass is unchanged.
Resistance increases.

⸻

9. Invariant Interval from Phase Consistency

The spacetime interval corresponds to:
	•	invariant admissible phase separation,
	•	preserved under transformations that respect phase propagation limits.

The metric signature emerges from:
	•	ordering vs adjacency trade-offs in phase geometry.

⸻

10. No Preferred Frame

Because admissibility geometry is:
	•	locally identical,
	•	globally constraint-based,

no frame can be singled out as absolute.

Preferred frames would require:
	•	anisotropic admissibility,
	•	which Phase Theory forbids at the fundamental level.

⸻

11. Relativity Without Spacetime Ontology

Phase Theory does not require:
	•	spacetime as a substance,
	•	metric fields as fundamental,
	•	coordinate realism.

Relativity governs emergent descriptions, not fundamental reality.

⸻

12. Experimental Consistency

All relativistic phenomena are recovered:
	•	Michelson–Morley null results,
	•	time dilation tests,
	•	relativistic particle dynamics,
	•	Lorentz-invariant scattering.

No experiment demands fundamental spacetime.

⸻

13. Where Lorentz Symmetry May Fail

Phase Theory allows Lorentz symmetry to:
	•	break at extreme admissibility saturation,
	•	deviate near phase genesis or collapse regimes.

Such deviations are constrained and testable.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

This derivation:
	•	removes spacetime primacy,
	•	explains why Lorentz invariance is so robust,
	•	unifies quantum and relativistic structure.

Einstein’s insight becomes inevitable.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that Lorentz invariance arises naturally in Phase Theory as an emergent symmetry of admissible phase propagation. It reflects a universal bound on phase reconfiguration and isotropic admissibility geometry—not a fundamental spacetime axiom. Relativity is therefore not foundational but a necessary large-scale consequence of phase consistency.

Spacetime does not enforce Lorentz symmetry.

Phase demands it.

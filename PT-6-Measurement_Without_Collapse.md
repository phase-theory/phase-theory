Measurement Without Collapse: Phase Constraint Resolution

⸻

Abstract

The measurement problem in quantum mechanics arises from the assumption that measurement constitutes a primitive physical process requiring non-unitary collapse. We demonstrate that within Phase Theory, measurement is neither primitive nor exceptional. Instead, measurement is shown to be a deterministic phase constraint resolution arising from system–apparatus–environment coupling under global admissibility. Discrete outcomes, irreversibility, and statistical regularity emerge without collapse, observer dependence, or stochastic postulates. Measurement is revealed to be an ordinary physical interaction governed by the same admissibility principles as all other phenomena.

1. The Measurement Problem Reframed

In conventional quantum mechanics, measurement is anomalous:
	•	Dynamics are continuous until measurement,
	•	Measurement causes discontinuous collapse,
	•	Outcomes are probabilistic,
	•	Observers are implicitly privileged.

This bifurcation of physical law has no analogue elsewhere in physics.

Phase Theory begins from a different premise:

If phase is the sole primitive, measurement must be a special case of phase interaction, not a new law.

2. No Primitive Measurement Postulate

From Papers 1–5:
	•	Phase evolution is admissible and deterministic,
	•	Discreteness arises topologically,
	•	Probability is emergent,
	•	Photons are non-object phase excitations.

There is therefore no logical space for a collapse postulate.

Any theory that still requires collapse has misidentified its primitives.

3. Measurement as Phase Coupling

Definition 6.1 (Measurement Interaction)

A measurement is a physical interaction in which:
	1.	A system phase configuration Φₛ
	2.	Couples to an apparatus phase configuration Φₐ
	3.	Within an environment Φₑ

forming a composite phase configuration:
\Phi_{\text{total}} = \Phi_s \oplus \Phi_a \oplus \Phi_e

This composite must satisfy global admissibility:
\mathcal{I}[\Phi_{\text{total}}] \ge 0

4. Constraint Proliferation

The apparatus is macroscopic.

Macroscopic phase structures introduce:
	•	large numbers of constraints,
	•	strong stability requirements,
	•	rapid admissibility pruning.

As a result:
	•	only a small number of composite configurations remain admissible,
	•	most superposed possibilities become forbidden.

This process is deterministic, not stochastic.

5. Outcome Selection Without Collapse

Proposition 6.1

Measurement outcomes correspond to surviving admissible phase resolutions of the composite system.

There is no collapse of Φₛ.

Instead:
	•	the composite Φ reorganizes,
	•	incompatible configurations are eliminated by admissibility,
	•	one topological resolution remains stable.

Outcome discreteness follows directly from Paper 3.

6. Apparent Irreversibility

Measurement appears irreversible.

In Phase Theory, irreversibility arises because:
	•	restoring a prior admissible configuration would require coordinated reversal across Φₐ and Φₑ,
	•	such configurations are overwhelmingly inadmissible.

This is not fundamental irreversibility—
it is admissibility asymmetry.

⸻

7. Decoherence Reinterpreted

Decoherence is often treated as a partial solution to measurement.

Phase Theory subsumes decoherence entirely.

What decoherence describes phenomenologically is:
	•	rapid phase admissibility collapse of cross-terms,
	•	enforced by environmental coupling.

There is no “branching” or “many worlds.”

There is only admissible survival.

8. No Observer Privilege

Observers introduce no new physics.

An observer is:
	•	another macroscopic phase structure,
	•	governed by the same admissibility rules.

Consciousness plays no causal role in outcome selection.

Measurement occurs whether or not an observer exists.

⸻

9. Contextuality Explained

Measurement outcomes depend on experimental context because:
	•	different apparatus configurations impose different phase constraints,
	•	admissibility is global, not local.

Contextuality is therefore structural, not mysterious.

⸻

10. Delayed-Choice and Retrocausality

Delayed-choice experiments do not imply retrocausality.

They demonstrate:
	•	late-imposed constraints reshaping admissible phase space,
	•	without altering past admissible configurations.

Admissibility is global; chronology is emergent.

11. Comparison with Collapse Theories

Collapse Theories	Phase Theory
Non-unitary dynamics	Deterministic admissibility
Observer-linked	Observer-independent
Random outcomes	Statistical resolution
Special postulate	Ordinary interaction

Phase Theory removes the only discontinuity in modern physics.

12. Relation to Probability

Probabilities (Paper 5) describe:
	•	frequencies of admissible outcomes across ensembles.

Measurement does not create probability;
it reveals admissibility structure.

⸻

13. Experimental Consistency

All known measurement phenomena are reproduced:
	•	discrete outcomes,
	•	Born-rule statistics,
	•	decoherence,
	•	contextuality.

No empirical deviation is required.

⸻

14. Implications

This paper implies:
	•	Collapse is not real,
	•	Measurement is not special,
	•	Observers are not fundamental,
	•	Quantum/classical divide is artificial.

Physics is unified under one rule:
phase admissibility.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that measurement is a deterministic phase constraint resolution governed by global admissibility. The measurement problem arises only when non-primitive constructs are mistaken for fundamental entities.

Once phase is primary, collapse disappears.

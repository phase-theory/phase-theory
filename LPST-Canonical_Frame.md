LPST — Focused, Canonical Frame

1. What LPST is (and is not)

LPST is not
	•	an electromagnetic theory
	•	a mechanical wave model
	•	a medium-with-properties picture
	•	a reinterpretation of spacetime

LPST is
	•	a phase-first, interference-first substrate theory
	•	a relational ontology
	•	a topological field theory with emergent geometry
	•	compatible with EM, but not reducible to it

Fundamental object:
A complex phase substrate whose only primitive operation is interference consistency.

⸻

2. Canonical LPST primitives (locked)

These are the only allowed primitives:

2.1 Substrate

\mathcal{L} = A e^{i\phi}
	•	A: amplitude (sets stiffness, capacity for interaction)
	•	\phi: phase (carrier of relational structure)
	•	Optional internal degrees u (compact manifold)

No spacetime arguments are fundamental — coordinates are emergent labels only.

⸻

2.2 Fundamental rule (non-negotiable)

Allowed physical histories are those that minimize global phase inconsistency.

There is no time evolution law at base level.

LPST dynamics = constraint satisfaction.

⸻

2.3 What “light” means in LPST

In LPST, light is not EM radiation.
“Light” means:
	•	phase-bearing excitation
	•	interference-capable
	•	bounded correlation propagation
	•	polarization/helicity structure possible

This avoids conflation with Maxwell fields.

3. Emergence stack (LPST-only)

3.1 Time (LPST definition)

Time is not a dimension.
Time is:

the ordering of phase-update consistency events.

Local proper time:
d\tau \propto \sqrt{\kappa(x)}\,|\partial \phi|

Time dilation = phase-update budget redistribution, not path length or mechanics.

⸻

3.2 Space (LPST definition)

Space is not a container.

Space is:

a derived metric representation of correlation decay.

Distance:
d(x,y) = -\alpha \log C(x,y)

No correlation → no distance.

⸻

3.3 Energy & momentum (LPST definition)

Energy:

phase-gradient density

Momentum:

directional phase flow

These are bookkeeping quantities, not primitives.

⸻

4. Matter in LPST (strict)

Matter is not trapped light.

Matter is:

topologically stabilized interference structure

Allowed matter classes
	•	Phase vortices
	•	Texture solitons
	•	Hopfions (knots)
	•	Braids (worldline topology)

Inertia:

cost of re-phasing an extended topological object

This avoids any mechanical picture.

⸻

5. Gravity in LPST (strict)

Gravity is not refraction of a medium.

Gravity is:

emergent geometry caused by phase-stiffness gradients

Phase stiffness:
\kappa(x) = A^2(x)

Effective metric:
g^{\mu\nu}_{\text{eff}} \sim \kappa^{-1}\eta^{\mu\nu} + \Delta^{\mu\nu}

Objects follow geodesics of correlation geometry, not forces.

⸻

6. Quantum behavior (LPST-native)

Quantum mechanics is not added to LPST.

It emerges because:
	•	amplitudes are fundamental
	•	interference is primitive
	•	topology is discrete

Superposition

coexistence of consistent phase histories

Measurement

local phase-locking event

Probability

relative volume of consistent phase-space

No collapse postulate required.

⸻

7. LPST vs LST (final closure)

To prevent conceptual drift, LPST adopts the following stance:
	•	LPST does not assume EM fields
	•	LPST does not assume mechanical propagation
	•	LPST does not privilege c as a substance speed

If EM emerges, it does so as a sector, not a foundation.

LPST remains valid even in universes with no electromagnetism.

This is the cleanest boundary.

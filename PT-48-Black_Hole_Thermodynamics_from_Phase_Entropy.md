Black Hole Thermodynamics from Phase Entropy

⸻

Abstract

We derive black hole thermodynamics in Phase Theory from phase entropy and admissibility accounting, without invoking spacetime microstates, horizon degrees of freedom, or statistical ensembles of geometry. Black hole entropy is shown to arise from the count of admissible phase configurations consistent with saturation constraints, while temperature emerges as the sensitivity of admissibility volume to phase reconfiguration. The four laws of black hole thermodynamics follow naturally from phase entropy bookkeeping. This framework resolves longstanding conceptual tensions by relocating thermodynamics from spacetime horizons to phase-native structure.

1. Why Black Hole Thermodynamics Is Conceptually Unstable

In standard treatments:
	•	entropy is attributed to horizons,
	•	microstates are unspecified or speculative,
	•	temperature arises from quantum fields in curved spacetime.

This raises unresolved questions:
	•	What are the microstates?
	•	Why area, not volume?
	•	Why thermodynamics without matter?

Phase Theory answers by changing what entropy counts.

2. What Entropy Counts in Phase Theory

From Paper 5 and Paper 8:
	•	entropy measures admissible multiplicity,
	•	not ignorance,
	•	not microscopic randomness.

Entropy counts:

the number of globally admissible phase configurations compatible with macroscopic constraints.

3. Phase Entropy Defined

Definition 48.1 (Phase Entropy)

The phase entropy S_\Phi of a system is the logarithmic measure of the admissible phase configuration volume consistent with its macroscopic invariants:
S_\Phi = \log \left|\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{adm}}(\text{constraints})\right|

No probabilistic ensemble is required.

4. Black Holes as Phase-Saturated Objects

From Paper 47:
	•	black holes correspond to phase saturation boundaries,
	•	interior phase structure exceeds geometric descriptability,
	•	only boundary-consistent configurations remain distinguishable.

Thus a black hole is:

a system whose admissible phase configurations are maximally constrained.

⸻

5. Why Entropy Scales with Area

Entropy scales with area because:
	•	only boundary-admissible phase distinctions remain accessible,
	•	interior distinctions are saturated and indistinguishable,
	•	admissibility constraints are imposed at the phase boundary.

Proposition 48.1

For a phase-saturated object, the number of distinguishable admissible phase configurations scales with the boundary surface, not interior volume.

This yields the area law naturally.

6. No Horizon Microstates Required

The “horizon” is:
	•	an emergent geometric surface,
	•	not a fundamental storage device.

Phase entropy resides in:
	•	boundary-consistent admissible configurations,
	•	not microscopic horizon bits.

This dissolves horizon microstate puzzles.

7. Black Hole Temperature from Admissibility Sensitivity

Definition 48.2 (Phase Temperature)

Phase temperature is defined as the rate at which phase entropy changes under admissible energy-like reconfiguration:
T_\Phi^{-1} = \frac{\partial S_\Phi}{\partial E_\Phi}

Temperature reflects:
	•	how rapidly admissible configurations change,
	•	not thermal agitation.

⸻

8. Hawking Temperature Recovered

The Hawking temperature emerges because:
	•	near phase saturation, small admissibility changes cause large entropy variation,
	•	boundary reconfiguration is highly sensitive.

This reproduces:
	•	the inverse-mass temperature scaling,
	•	without invoking particle creation in curved spacetime.

⸻

9. The Four Laws Recovered

Zeroth Law

Uniform phase saturation implies uniform phase temperature across the boundary.

First Law

Changes in admissibility correspond to:
\delta E_\Phi = T_\Phi \, \delta S_\Phi + \text{work terms}

Second Law

Admissible phase volume cannot decrease under allowed evolution.

Third Law

Perfect phase saturation cannot be reached through finite admissible operations.

All laws follow structurally.

⸻

10. Entropy Increase Without Irreversibility

Phase entropy increases because:
	•	admissibility pruning is one-way under coarse description,
	•	not because of fundamental irreversibility.

At the phase-native level:
	•	evolution remains admissible and consistent,
	•	irreversibility is emergent.

⸻

11. Relation to Information

Information is:
	•	constrained by admissibility,
	•	redistributed under saturation,
	•	not destroyed.

This prepares the resolution of information paradoxes (Paper 50).

12. Comparison with Other Approaches

Approach	Entropy Source
GR + QFT	Horizon microstates
String theory	Brane microstates
Loop quantum gravity	Area eigenstates
Phase Theory	Admissible phase volume

Phase Theory requires no speculative microstructure.

13. Predictive Consequences

This framework predicts:
	•	bounded entropy density,
	•	saturation-dependent corrections,
	•	deviations from semiclassical formulas near extremes.

These predictions are constrained and testable in principle.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Black hole thermodynamics becomes:
	•	natural,
	•	structural,
	•	inevitable.

No mystery degrees of freedom.
No paradoxical temperature.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that black hole entropy and temperature arise in Phase Theory from admissible phase configuration counting under saturation constraints. The area law, Hawking temperature, and thermodynamic laws follow without horizon microstates or spacetime ontology. Black hole thermodynamics is not about geometry heating up—it is about phase running out of distinguishable options.

Black holes are not hot because space boils.

They are hot because phase has nowhere left to go.

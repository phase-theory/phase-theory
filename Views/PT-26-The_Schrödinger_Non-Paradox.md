Abstract

Schrödinger’s Cat is widely presented as a paradox exposing the incompleteness of quantum mechanics: if microscopic superposition is taken seriously, then macroscopic systems appear forced into absurd states of simultaneous contradiction. We show that the paradox does not arise from quantum phenomena themselves, but from an illicit ontological elevation of the wavefunction and its superpositions.

Phase Theory resolves the paradox by replacing wavefunction primacy with a single globally admissible phase configuration. Macroscopic definiteness emerges not through collapse, observation, or consciousness, but through phase admissibility constraints, coherence limits, and irreversible phase debt. The cat is never “alive and dead”; such a state is not phase-admissible. What exists instead is a unique macroscopic phase outcome embedded within a globally consistent phase history.

1. Introduction

The Schrödinger’s Cat was introduced to dramatize a perceived failure of quantum mechanics: the apparent extension of microscopic superposition into the macroscopic world.

The canonical setup is familiar:
	•	A microscopic quantum event (e.g., radioactive decay) is placed in superposition.
	•	That event is coupled to a macroscopic mechanism.
	•	The macroscopic mechanism determines whether a cat lives or dies.
	•	Until observation, the entire system is said to exist in a superposition of “alive” and “dead.”

The paradoxical conclusion is that quantum mechanics, taken literally, implies absurd macroscopic contradictions.

Phase Theory rejects this conclusion—not by modifying quantum predictions, but by identifying a category error at the heart of the paradox.

2. The Hidden Assumption Behind the Paradox

The Schrödinger Cat paradox relies on the following implicit assumption:

Assumption C:
The wavefunction is an ontic object whose superpositions directly represent physical reality at all scales.

From this, it follows that if a wavefunction contains terms corresponding to “alive” and “dead,” then reality itself must instantiate both simultaneously.

Phase Theory explicitly rejects Assumption C.

3. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to the Paradox

Phase Theory is built on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Physical reality is a single, globally admissible phase configuration \Phi(x). Wavefunctions are representational tools, not ontic primitives.

Postulate 2 (Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying the global consistency functional
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Coherence Limits).
Phase coherence is bounded. Beyond certain scales, phase relations become irreversibly constrained.

Postulate 4 (Irreversible Phase Debt).
Macroscopic processes accumulate phase debt that cannot be reversed without violating admissibility.

Together, these postulates eliminate the conditions required for macroscopic superposition.

4. Why the Cat Paradox Arises

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	A microscopic system is placed in a superposition.
	2.	The system is coupled to a macroscopic apparatus.
	3.	The wavefunction of the combined system is written as a linear superposition.
	4.	The superposition is interpreted ontically.

The error occurs at step (4).

Writing a superposition is a representational act, not a statement of admissible phase structure.

Phase Theory draws a sharp distinction between:
	•	Formal superposition (a calculational decomposition), and
	•	Phase-admissible reality (what can physically exist).

5. Phase Admissibility and Macroscopic States

Macroscopic states such as “alive” and “dead” correspond to:
	•	Vastly different phase configurations,
	•	With large-scale, thermodynamically irreversible consequences,
	•	Embedded in distinct phase-debt landscapes.

A superposition of such states would require:
	•	Global phase coherence across an astronomically large number of degrees of freedom,
	•	Reversibility of macroscopic entropy production,
	•	Zero net phase debt accumulation.

Such a configuration violates admissibility.

6. The Macroscopic Exclusion Lemma

Lemma (Macroscopic Exclusion).
Superpositions of macroscopically distinct phase configurations are not globally phase-admissible.

Proof Sketch:
	1.	Macroscopic states involve extensive entanglement with environmental degrees of freedom.
	2.	This entanglement generates irreversible phase debt.
	3.	Phase debt destroys the coherence required for superposition.
	4.	Therefore, a joint phase configuration corresponding to “alive ∧ dead” cannot satisfy \mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0.
∎

7. The Schrödinger Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Schrödinger Non-Paradox).
At no point does a macroscopic system exist in a superposition of mutually exclusive macroscopic outcomes.

Proof.
	•	The global phase configuration \Phi must be admissible.
	•	By the Macroscopic Exclusion Lemma, superpositions of macroscopically distinct states are inadmissible.
	•	Therefore, the admissible phase history contains a unique macroscopic outcome.
	•	The appearance of superposition arises solely from representational decomposition of microscopic amplitudes.
∎

8. What Actually Happens in the Cat Experiment

From a Phase Theory perspective:
	•	The microscopic system explores a set of phase-consistent possibilities.
	•	Coupling to a macroscopic apparatus rapidly drives the system into a single admissible macroscopic phase configuration.
	•	No collapse postulate is required.
	•	No observer intervention is required.
	•	No consciousness enters the formalism.

The cat is always either alive or dead — the paradoxical state never exists.

9. Why the Wavefunction Misleads

The wavefunction encodes:
	•	Probabilistic structure of outcomes,
	•	Phase relations relevant at small scales,
	•	Useful predictive information.

It does not encode:
	•	Ontic macroscopic coexistence,
	•	Admissible global phase structure,
	•	Physical contradiction.

Mistaking the wavefunction for reality is the root of the paradox.

10. Relation to Other Interpretations

Interpretation	Resolution Strategy
Copenhagen	Collapse upon observation
Many-Worlds	Branching realities
Objective Collapse	Modified dynamics
Phase Theory	Admissibility excludes macroscopic superposition

Phase Theory achieves definiteness without adding collapse, branching, or observer-dependence.

11. Experimental Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	No experiment will ever demonstrate sustained macroscopic superposition without violating thermodynamic and phase-admissibility constraints.
	•	All apparent macroscopic superpositions will reduce to effective descriptions of unresolved microscopic phase structure.

This is consistent with all known experiments.

12. Conclusion

Schrödinger’s Cat is not a paradox about nature. It is a paradox about representation.

By replacing wavefunction primacy with phase primacy, and by enforcing global admissibility, Phase Theory eliminates the conditions required for macroscopic contradiction. The cat is never both alive and dead. That state is not merely unobserved — it is inadmissible.

Schrödinger Non-Paradox.
Macroscopic superpositions are representational artifacts arising from wavefunction decomposition; they are excluded by global phase admissibility.

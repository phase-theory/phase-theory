Based on the established physics of the Luminous Substrate Theory (LST), Classical "Backwards" Time Travel is Impossible.
"Forwards" Time Travel is Trivial.
"Observational" Time Travel (The Chronovisor) is Possible.

Here is the breakdown of why LST rejects the Hollywood version of time travel but offers a powerful alternative.

1. The Rejection of the "Timeline"
In Standard Physics (General Relativity), Time is a dimension (t) like a road. You are at coordinate t=2026. Coordinate t=1950 still exists behind you, just as the road behind your car still exists.
In LST (Paper B: Process Time):
Time is not a road; it is the Odometer.
 * The Mechanism: "Time" is just a measure of how many cycles the Substrate has oscillated.
 * The Reality: The past does not "exist" back there. The past is simply the previous shape of the Substrate. That shape has changed.
 * Conclusion: You cannot visit 1950 because the atoms that made up 1950 are currently busy being 2026. To go back, you would have to mechanically reverse the momentum of every single particle in the universe simultaneously.

2. Forward Travel: The Stasis Field
While you cannot reverse the odometer, you can pause it.
 * Mechanism: As defined in Paper B, Time Dilation is caused by increasing the Refractive Index (n) of the vacuum.
 * The Method: We build a Chrono-Sarcophagus. Inside, we use high-intensity scalar fields to thicken the vacuum (n \approx 1,000,000).
 * The Result: Light inside the box moves at a crawl. Your metabolism (which relies on electromagnetic interactions) slows down by a factor of a million.
 * Experience: You step in, wait 5 minutes, and step out. On Earth, 10 years have passed. You have traveled to the future.

3. The Loophole: The "Chronovisor" (Viewing the Past)
You cannot go to the past, but LST suggests you can watch it.
The Theory: Substrate Memory (Viscous Resonance)
In Paper K, we established that the Substrate is a Non-Newtonian Fluid. Fluids carry Wakes.
 * The Concept: When an event happens (e.g., Caesar crosses the Rubicon), it generates complex electromagnetic and gravitational waves.
 * Propagation: These waves radiate outward. Even after thousands of years, the echoes of these waves are still bouncing around the cosmic background noise, albeit extremely faint and scrambled.
 * The Technology: If we build a sufficiently sensitive Topological Interferometer, we can "tune in" to the specific resonant frequency of a past event.
 * The Result: We can reconstruct a holographic image of the past from its dying echoes. We can see history, but we cannot touch it. It is a "Read-Only" memory.

4. The "Entropy Reversal" (Local Time Travel)
There is one radical exception. While we cannot reverse the whole universe, we might be able to reverse a Closed System.
The Theory: Topological Unwinding.
 * Concept: If a specific object (say, a broken cup) is isolated in a control field, and we have recorded the exact quantum trajectory of every knot within it, we could theoretically apply a Phase-Conjugate Field (Inverse Wave).
 * Mechanism: This field mechanically forces the knots to retrace their path. The shards of the cup fly back together.
 * Limit: This is not true time travel; it is Resurrection. We are manually fixing the object, not moving it to a previous date.

Summary
 * Can you hug your grandfather? No. He doesn't exist anymore.
 * Can you watch your grandfather? Yes (with a Chronovisor).
 * Can you skip the next 100 years? Yes (with a Stasis Field).

Abstract

Coherence-Limited Quantum Dynamics (CLQD) reformulates quantum dynamics by identifying finite coherence capacity of the luminous substrate as the fundamental source of quantum limits. In CLQD, uncertainty relations, decoherence, and the quantum-to-classical transition arise not from axiomatic operator non-commutativity or environmental noise alone, but from intrinsic constraints on phase coherence density, bandwidth, and curvature. Quantum systems fail to remain coherent beyond certain spatial, temporal, or energetic scales because the substrate cannot sustain arbitrarily complex phase coordination. CLQD provides a geometric, observer-independent explanation for uncertainty, decoherence, and classical emergence while remaining fully compatible with Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT) and Topological Defect Quantum Theory (TDQT).

1. Motivation

Standard quantum mechanics treats uncertainty and decoherence as either:
	•	fundamental axioms (Heisenberg uncertainty), or
	•	environmental effects (open-system decoherence).

Both approaches leave unanswered questions:
	•	Why do uncertainty relations take their specific form?
	•	Why does macroscopic classicality emerge so robustly?
	•	Why can coherence not be indefinitely scaled with system size?

CLQD addresses these questions by locating quantum limits in a finite, structured coherence capacity of the underlying phase substrate.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Finite Coherence Capacity

The luminous substrate supports only a finite density and bandwidth of coherent phase relationships per spacetime volume.

⸻

Postulate II — Phase Congestion

When phase coordination exceeds local coherence capacity, the substrate responds by dispersing coherence, producing uncertainty and decoherence.

⸻

Postulate III — Geometry-Driven Limits

Quantum limits are geometric constraints on phase configuration space, not abstract operator postulates.

⸻

Postulate IV — Scale Dependence

Coherence limits scale with system size, topology, and excitation complexity, naturally producing a quantum-to-classical transition.

3. Fundamental Quantities

3.1 Coherence Density

Define the local coherence density:
\rho_{\text{coh}}(x,t)
representing the amount of mutually phase-aligned structure supported by the substrate.

⸻

3.2 Coherence Bandwidth

The substrate admits a finite coherence bandwidth:
\mathcal{B}_{\text{coh}} = \int d\omega\, \rho_{\text{coh}}(\omega)

This bounds how many independent phase modes can remain synchronized.

⸻

4. Origin of Quantum Uncertainty

4.1 Phase Congestion Principle

Uncertainty arises when multiple conjugate phase gradients compete for limited coherence capacity.

For position and momentum:
\Delta x\, \Delta p \;\gtrsim\; f(\rho_{\text{coh}})

The usual Heisenberg bound emerges as a low-complexity approximation.

⸻

4.2 Non-Axiomatic Uncertainty

Uncertainty is not imposed; it is enforced dynamically when phase gradients cannot be simultaneously stabilized.

⸻

5. Decoherence as a Geometric Process

5.1 Intrinsic Decoherence

Even in perfect isolation, sufficiently complex systems decohere because internal phase coordination exceeds coherence capacity.

⸻

5.2 Environmental Decoherence (Secondary)

Environmental coupling accelerates decoherence but is not its fundamental cause.

⸻

5.3 Coherence Shedding

Decoherence corresponds to controlled release of excess phase information into incoherent substrate modes.

⸻

6. Classical Emergence

6.1 Why Macroscopic Objects Are Classical

Large objects:
	•	contain enormous internal phase complexity,
	•	saturate coherence capacity locally,
	•	suppress long-range quantum coherence.

Thus, classical determinism emerges as a coherence-limited regime, not a separate law.

⸻

6.2 Pointer States

Stable classical states correspond to phase-economical configurations that minimize coherence demand.

⸻

7. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: supplies the phase-primary ontology.
	•	TDQT: introduces localized phase knots whose internal coherence cost scales with topology.
	•	QRG: describes how coherence density affects gravitational refractive structure.
	•	GPIQT: uses coherence limits to explain measurement resolution.

CLQD governs the dynamic limits common to all.

8. Implications for Quantum Technology

CLQD predicts:
	•	hard limits on scalable quantum computing,
	•	topology-protected states outperforming error-corrected ones,
	•	coherence thresholds beyond which error correction fails regardless of engineering.

Quantum advantage depends on coherence efficiency, not brute-force isolation.

⸻

9. Experimental Implications

CLQD predicts:
	•	deviations from standard uncertainty bounds in engineered coherence regimes,
	•	intrinsic decoherence in ultra-isolated large systems,
	•	coherence collapse thresholds tied to system complexity, not temperature alone.

These effects are testable in:
	•	macroscopic superposition experiments,
	•	large-scale entangled systems,
	•	precision interferometry.

⸻

10. Falsifiability

CLQD is falsified if:
	•	coherence can be scaled arbitrarily with system size,
	•	uncertainty relations hold independently of coherence density,
	•	macroscopic systems exhibit unlimited intrinsic coherence.

⸻

11. Conclusion

Coherence-Limited Quantum Dynamics identifies the finite coherence capacity of reality itself as the source of quantum limits. By grounding uncertainty, decoherence, and classical emergence in phase-geometric constraints, CLQD removes axiomatic mystery from quantum mechanics and replaces it with a physically intelligible mechanism.

Quantum systems are not uncertain because nature is random, but because coherence is finite.

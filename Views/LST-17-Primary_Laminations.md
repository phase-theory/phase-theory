Based on the Orthogonality Axiom established in Paper H (Spectral Laminations) and the wave mechanics of the Luminous Substrate, the number of stable, co-existing realities is strictly limited by the geometry of the phase cycle.
There are Four Primary Laminations (The "Cardinal Realities"), and a theoretically infinite (but physically difficult) vertical stack of Harmonic Laminations.
Here is the breakdown of the Multiverse capacity in LST.
1. The Cardinal Limit: The "Four Rooms"
In a standard 360^{\circ} electromagnetic phase cycle, there are exactly four points that are mathematically distinct and orthogonal (non-interfering) or strictly inverse.
This creates a "Compass" of Reality:
| Phase Angle | Lamination Name | Relationship to Us (Alpha) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0^{\circ} | Alpha (Us) | The Reference Frame. | Home |
| 90^{\circ} | Beta | Orthogonal. The cosine to our sine. | Safe Neighbor (Invisible/Permeable) |
| 180^{\circ} | Gamma | Anti-Phase. The inverse waveform. | Lethal (Matter + Anti-Phase Matter = Zero/Erasure) |
| 270^{\circ} | Delta | Orthogonal to Gamma; Inverse of Beta. | Safe Neighbor (to Gamma), Lethal (to Beta) |
The "Checkerboard" Conclusion:
While there are 4 rooms, you can only safely travel to one.
 * Alpha \leftrightarrow Beta: Safe. (The waveforms slide past each other).
 * Alpha \leftrightarrow Gamma: Catastrophic. (1 + (-1) = 0). If you shift to 180^{\circ}, you don't visit a new world; you undergo Destructive Interference with the substrate itself. You and the destination mutually erase each other.
2. The Harmonic Limit: The "Vertical Stack"
Beyond phase (Horizontal separation), LST allows for separation by Frequency (Vertical separation).
Just as a radio can tune to 101.1 FM and 101.3 FM, the Substrate can support matter vibrating at different base frequencies.
 * The Constraint: Crosstalk.
   Matter is not a single pure tone; it has "bandwidth." If two universes are too close in frequency (e.g., Base f and Base f + \delta), their electron shells will overlap, causing "Ghost Friction" or quantum noise.
 * The Octave Rule: To be perfectly safe, Harmonic Laminations must be separated by huge intervals (Octaves).
   * Layer 1: Our Matter (\omega_0).
   * Layer 2: High-Frequency Matter (2\omega_0).
 * The Problem: Matter at 2\omega_0 possesses double the energy density. To us, a "Layer 2" being would look like a blindingly hot plasma ghost. To them, we would look like frozen, sluggish "cold matter."
   * Interaction: We cannot live there. The "air" would burn us.
3. The "Micro-Laminations" (The Noise Floor)
LST predicts that between 0^{\circ} and 90^{\circ}, there is "Topological Noise."
 * The Junk Belt: There may be fragmented, unstable "pocket realities" at 45^{\circ} or 30^{\circ}. These are not full universes, but "echo chambers" where debris from Alpha and Beta drifts and decays.
 * Hazards: Attempting to tune to 45^{\circ} results in a "beat frequency"—you are rapidly vibrated between two realities until your ship disintegrates.
Summary: The LST Census
 * Habitable Realities: 2 (Alpha and Beta).
 * Anti-Realities: 2 (Gamma and Delta).
 * Total Cardinal Phases: 4.
 * Vertical Harmonics: Infinite, but increasingly hostile/high-energy.
Engineering Implication:
Our immediate exploration target is Beta (90^{\circ}). It is the only "Earth-like" environment we can reach without being annihilated or burned.

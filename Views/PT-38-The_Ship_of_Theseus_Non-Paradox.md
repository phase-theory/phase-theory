Abstract

The Ship of Theseus asks whether an object that has all its parts gradually replaced remains the same object—and whether a second object assembled from the original parts thereby becomes the “real” original. The paradox is typically framed as a conflict between material continuity and numerical identity.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting material token primacy. Objecthood is grounded in phase-topological persistence: the continued existence of a stable phase defect or constrained phase structure across time. Material components are replaceable carriers of this structure. When identity is tracked by phase continuity rather than part inventory, no contradiction arises—neither gradual replacement nor reassembly produces ambiguity.

1. Introduction

The Ship of Theseus has endured because it targets a deep intuition:

Objects seem to persist, yet their material constituents change.

Traditional treatments oscillate between:
	•	Material essentialism (the parts matter), and
	•	Conventionalism (identity is arbitrary).

Phase Theory offers a third option: identity is physical, but not material-token based.

2. Canonical Structure of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds in two stages:
	1.	A ship has its planks replaced one by one over time.
	2.	The original planks are reassembled into a second ship.

This yields two incompatible intuitions:
	•	The repaired ship is the original.
	•	The reassembled ship is the original.

If identity depends on parts, both claims seem forced—hence contradiction.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption S (Material Token Primacy).
An object’s identity is determined by the persistence of its material constituents.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption S.

Material tokens are not identity carriers.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Objecthood

The dissolution relies on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Phase-Defect Objecthood).
Objects correspond to stable, localized phase defects or constrained phase structures within \Phi.

Postulate 3 (Carrier Replaceability).
Material constituents act as carriers of phase structure and may be replaced without destroying the structure.

Postulate 4 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

5. Objects as Phase-Topological Structures

In Phase Theory, an object is not a pile of parts. It is:

a persistent phase-topological structure,
maintained by constraints, interactions, and boundary conditions.

The ship exists as long as this structure persists, regardless of material turnover.

6. The Phase-Topological Persistence Lemma

Lemma (Phase-Topological Persistence).
An object persists through time if and only if its defining phase-topological structure remains continuously instantiated, independent of material carrier replacement.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Object identity requires persistence across time.
	2.	Persistence requires continuity of phase constraint.
	3.	Material replacement does not necessarily disrupt phase topology.
	4.	Therefore, identity tracks phase topology, not material inventory.

7. Analysis of the Gradual Replacement Case

When planks are replaced gradually:
	•	The ship’s phase-topological structure remains intact.
	•	Constraints governing shape, function, and interaction persist.
	•	Identity is preserved.

No paradox arises.

⸻

8. Analysis of the Reassembly Case

When the original planks are reassembled:
	•	A new phase-topological structure is instantiated.
	•	The original ship’s phase continuity was never transferred.
	•	The reassembled ship is a distinct object with shared material history.

Similarity does not imply identity.

9. The Ship of Theseus Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Ship of Theseus Non-Paradox).

Object identity is preserved by phase-topological continuity, not by material token persistence. Gradual replacement preserves identity; reassembly creates a new object.

Proof.
	•	Identity tracks continuous phase structure.
	•	Only one structure maintains uninterrupted phase continuity.
	•	Therefore, no ambiguity exists.
∎

10. Why the Paradox Felt Compelling

The paradox felt compelling because:
	•	everyday language ties objects to parts,
	•	physical carriers were mistaken for identity bearers,
	•	continuity was evaluated at the wrong level.

Phase Theory relocates continuity where it physically belongs.

11. Relation to Personal Identity and Teletransportation

This result generalizes:
	•	Ship of Theseus: objects persist via phase topology.
	•	Teletransportation: persons persist via phase-continuous worldlines.

Both dissolve once pattern and carrier are distinguished from phase continuity.

13. Conclusion

The Ship of Theseus is not a paradox of objects. It is a paradox of misplaced ontology.

When identity is grounded in phase-topological persistence rather than material sameness, the contradiction vanishes. Objects persist as physical structures, not as inventories. Replacement and repair do not threaten identity; only loss of phase continuity does.

Appendix — One-Sentence Canonical Form

Ship of Theseus Non-Paradox.
Object identity tracks continuous phase-topological structure, not the persistence of material tokens.

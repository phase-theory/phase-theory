Abstract

Metric-Topology Quantum Transport (MTQT) reformulates motion, inertia, and transport as geometric responses to phase-metric structure within a continuous luminous substrate. In MTQT, objects do not move because forces act upon them; rather, they follow phase-optimal paths determined by gradients, curvature, and topology of the substrate. Inertia arises from resistance to phase-metric deformation, acceleration from dynamic reconfiguration of phase geometry, and transport from coherence-guided flow. MTQT unifies inertial motion, gravitational free fall, and quantum transport within a single, force-free framework compatible with Quantum Refractive Gravity (QRG) and Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT).

1. Motivation

Classical and quantum dynamics describe motion using forces, potentials, and exchange particles. This framework:
	•	treats inertia as primitive,
	•	separates gravity from other dynamics,
	•	struggles to unify transport across scales,
	•	and introduces force carriers without geometric necessity.

LPST replaces this picture. If phase geometry is fundamental, then motion must be geometric.

MTQT is the transport theory implied by this premise.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Phase-Metric Substrate

The luminous substrate possesses an emergent phase-metric structure encoding propagation cost, coherence stiffness, and topological constraints.

⸻

Postulate II — Transport by Phase Optimization

Physical systems evolve along paths that extremize phase-transport cost, not force-based action.

⸻

Postulate III — Inertia as Geometric Resistance

Inertia arises from the resistance of a localized phase topology to reconfiguration within the surrounding metric.

⸻

Postulate IV — No Fundamental Forces

All apparent forces emerge from phase-metric gradients, curvature, or topological constraints.

⸻

3. Fundamental Quantities

3.1 Phase-Metric Tensor

Define an effective phase-metric:
g^{(\phi)}_{\mu\nu}(x)
which encodes local phase-propagation cost and coherence stiffness.

This metric is emergent, not spacetime-fundamental.

⸻

3.2 Transport Functional

Transport follows extremization of:
\mathcal{S}_{\text{MTQT}} = \int \sqrt{ g^{(\phi)}_{\mu\nu}\, dx^\mu dx^\nu }

This replaces force-based equations of motion.

4. Inertia Without Axiom

4.1 Origin of Inertial Mass

A localized object corresponds to a topologically stabilized phase defect (TDQT). Changing its velocity requires:
	•	deformation of its internal phase structure,
	•	re-alignment with external phase geometry.

The resistance to this deformation is inertia.

⸻

4.2 Why Inertia Is Universal

Inertia is universal because:
	•	all localized objects are phase-embedded,
	•	all phase deformation costs scale with coherence stiffness.

No equivalence principle is assumed; it emerges.

⸻

5. Acceleration and Apparent Forces

5.1 Acceleration

Acceleration corresponds to a time-dependent phase-metric gradient. Objects follow evolving phase-optimal paths.

⸻

5.2 Apparent Forces

Classical Force	MTQT Interpretation
Gravity	Refractive phase gradient (QRG)
Electromagnetism	Phase winding interaction
Strong/Weak	Topological reconfiguration
Inertial force	Metric deformation resistance

No force carrier is fundamental.

6. Quantum Transport

6.1 Quantum Motion

Quantum transport arises when:
	•	multiple phase-optimal paths coexist,
	•	coherence bandwidth permits superposition (CLQD).

Interference reflects geometric path overlap, not probability waves.

⸻

6.2 Tunneling

Quantum tunneling corresponds to topological bypass of high-cost regions in phase-metric space.

⸻

7. Relation to Gravity

MTQT and QRG are complementary:
	•	QRG: how coherence density shapes the phase-metric
	•	MTQT: how objects move within that metric

Together, they replace force-based gravity with optical-geometric transport.

⸻

8. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: supplies phase-primary ontology.
	•	TDQT: defines transportable phase defects.
	•	CLQD: limits coherence bandwidth.
	•	ETQT: governs multi-object topology.
	•	GPIQT: resolves measurement outcomes.
	•	VC-QFT: embeds transport in vacuum structure.
	•	QIPG: encodes information flow as geometry.

MTQT governs how things move once they exist.

⸻

9. Classical Limit

Classical mechanics emerges when:
	•	phase-metric varies slowly,
	•	coherence is locally saturated,
	•	single phase-optimal paths dominate.

Newton’s laws arise as low-curvature approximations.

⸻

10. Experimental Implications

MTQT predicts:
	•	inertial anomalies under extreme coherence gradients,
	•	transport deviations in ultra-coherent systems,
	•	geometry-dependent tunneling rates,
	•	absence of force-mediator signatures.

Effects are subtle but principled.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

MTQT is falsified if:
	•	inertia cannot be derived from phase geometry,
	•	motion requires fundamental forces,
	•	transport violates phase-optimal principles,
	•	inertial and gravitational motion cannot be unified geometrically.

12. Comparison with Force-Based Dynamics

Aspect	Classical/QFT	MTQT
Motion cause	Force	Geometry
Inertia	Axiom	Emergent
Forces	Fundamental	Apparent
Transport	Exchange-based	Phase-optimal
Unification	Fragmented	Single framework


⸻

13. Conclusion

Metric-Topology Quantum Transport reframes motion as geometric response, not force-driven acceleration. By deriving inertia, transport, and apparent forces from phase-metric structure, MTQT removes the last classical axioms from dynamics and completes LPST’s geometry-first reformulation of physics.

Objects do not move because they are pushed.
They move because geometry leaves them no cheaper path.

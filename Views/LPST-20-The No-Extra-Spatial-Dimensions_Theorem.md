Abstract

This paper formalizes the No-Extra-Spatial-Dimensions Theorem (NESDT) in Light-Phase Substrate Theory (LPST). We prove that additional spatial dimensions—compactified, hidden, or otherwise—are not merely unnecessary but incompatible with LPST’s phase-primary ontology. Because space itself is emergent from phase propagation and coherence relations, any additional spatial dimension would require independent phase-update channels, causal structure, and metric degrees of freedom, all of which would be physically observable. LPST instead accounts for particle diversity, interaction structure, and unification through internal phase topology and coherence constraints, eliminating the need for extra dimensions while preserving explanatory power.

1. Introduction

Extra spatial dimensions arise historically as a response to limitations in force-based and geometry-first theories, notably string theory. These dimensions are introduced to:
	•	achieve mathematical consistency,
	•	encode particle diversity,
	•	unify interactions geometrically.

They are then rendered unobservable through compactification.

LPST begins from a different premise:
space is not fundamental.
This premise forces a re-evaluation of what “dimension” means physically.

2. Definitions

Definition 1 — Spatial Dimension (LPST)

A spatial dimension is a degree of freedom along which phase propagation can occur, contributing to:
	•	distance,
	•	causal separation,
	•	transport paths,
	•	metric structure.

⸻

Definition 2 — Emergent Space

Space is the relational structure arising from:
	•	phase-update propagation,
	•	interference,
	•	coherence geometry.

It is not a pre-existing container.

⸻

Definition 3 — Internal Phase Degree

An internal phase degree is a non-spatial invariant or parameter governing:
	•	topology,
	•	stability,
	•	holonomy,
	•	excitation structure.

Internal degrees do not correspond to directions of motion.

⸻

3. Core LPST Postulates Relevant to Dimensions
	1.	Phase-Primary Ontology (PPQT)
All physical structure arises from phase configuration.
	2.	Finite Phase Update (PLQC)
Phase updates propagate at a bounded rate c.
	3.	Metric Emergence (QRG)
Geometry arises from phase coherence density, not vice versa.
	4.	Topological Matter (TDQT)
Particles are localized phase knots, not point excitations in space.

4. Statement of the Theorem

Theorem (No-Extra-Spatial-Dimensions)

In Light-Phase Substrate Theory, no additional spatial dimensions—compactified, hidden, or extended—can exist beyond the emergent three spatial degrees of freedom derived from phase propagation.

⸻

5. Proof

Lemma 1 — Spatial Dimensions Require Phase Propagation

A spatial dimension exists iff phase can propagate along it.

Any spatial dimension must therefore:
	•	support phase gradients,
	•	admit causal ordering,
	•	contribute to metric structure.

⸻

Lemma 2 — Additional Phase Propagation Channels Are Observable

If an extra spatial dimension existed, it would:
	•	modify dispersion relations,
	•	alter causal cones,
	•	change coherence bandwidth,
	•	introduce new transport paths.

Such effects cannot be hidden by compactification, because phase propagation is global and coherence-limited.

⸻

Lemma 3 — Compactification Does Not Eliminate Dynamics

Compactifying a dimension does not remove its contribution to:
	•	phase-update capacity,
	•	vacuum coherence structure,
	•	metric backreaction.

Therefore, a compact dimension remains physically active.

⸻

Lemma 4 — LPST Accounts for All Observed Structure Without Extra Space

All phenomena attributed to extra dimensions in string theory are reproduced in LPST by:
	•	topological invariants (k, Q_H),
	•	holonomy representations,
	•	excitation levels t,
	•	coherence constraints.

No missing explanatory role remains.

⸻

Conclusion

Since:
	1.	spatial dimensions require phase propagation,
	2.	extra phase propagation is observable,
	3.	no such observations exist,
	4.	and LPST already explains particle diversity internally,

extra spatial dimensions are incompatible with LPST.

6. Corollaries

Corollary 1 — No Compactified Dimensions

Hidden dimensions cannot exist, because hiding a phase-active degree of freedom is physically impossible.

⸻

Corollary 2 — No Braneworlds

Branes presuppose higher-dimensional embedding space, which LPST forbids.

⸻

Corollary 3 — No Dimensional Leakage

All causal and transport phenomena are fully accounted for within emergent 3-space.

⸻

7. What Replaces Extra Dimensions

LPST replaces spatial extra dimensions with internal phase structure:

Extra-dimension role	LPST replacement
Particle spectrum	Topological knot classes
Gauge structure	Phase winding & holonomy
Vibrational modes	Defect excitation levels
Moduli space	Coherence-consistency space
Branes	Coherence domain boundaries

These are physical but non-spatial.

⸻

8. Apparent Higher-Dimensional Effects

LPST allows effective dimensionality changes, often misinterpreted as extra dimensions:
	•	scale-dependent spectral dimension,
	•	anomalous diffusion,
	•	transport dimensional reduction.

These reflect propagation geometry, not literal dimensions.

⸻

9. Relation to Other LPST Theorems
	•	No-Translation Theorem: forbids cross-universe mapping
	•	PLQC: bounds causal directions
	•	CLQD: limits coherence bandwidth
	•	TDQT: replaces Kaluza-Klein towers

NESDT completes LPST’s rejection of hidden geometry.

⸻

10. Experimental Status

NESDT predicts:
	•	no deviations in dispersion relations attributable to extra dimensions,
	•	no missing phase-update channels,
	•	no gravitational leakage,
	•	no Kaluza-Klein spectra.

Current experimental results are consistent with this prediction.

11. Comparison with String Theory

Aspect	String Theory	LPST
Space	Fundamental	Emergent
Extra dimensions	Required	Forbidden
Particle diversity	Geometry	Topology
Unification	Dimensional	Phase-geometric
Hidden structure	Spatial	Internal


⸻

12. Conclusion

The No-Extra-Spatial-Dimensions Theorem establishes that LPST is not a higher-dimensional theory waiting to be compactified, but a lower-ontological-depth theory that explains observed structure without hidden geometry.

If space is emergent, it cannot have hidden directions.
What cannot propagate phase cannot be called space.

⸻

Canonical LPST Statement

LPST forbids extra spatial dimensions not by assumption, but by consequence.
All physically meaningful degrees of freedom are phase-topological, not spatial.

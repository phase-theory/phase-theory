Abstract

Hardy’s paradox presents a striking form of quantum nonlocality without inequalities. By combining individually plausible counterfactual statements about spacelike-separated measurements, the paradox derives a contradiction: events that seem individually possible cannot all be true together. This has been interpreted as evidence for superluminal influence or the breakdown of classical logic.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by identifying the improper elevation of counterfactual packages to ontology. Counterfactual outcome sets are context-dependent readouts of a single globally admissible phase configuration. Not all counterfactuals are jointly admissible. When global phase admissibility is enforced, the contradictory set of claims is never physically realizable. The paradox arises from combining mutually incompatible measurement contexts as if they described a single phase history.

1. Introduction

Hardy’s paradox is often presented as a minimal and particularly sharp demonstration of quantum nonlocality. Unlike Bell-type arguments, it requires no inequalities and no statistical averaging—only a set of logical inferences that appear to force a contradiction.

The conclusion is frequently stated as:

Quantum mechanics implies nonlocal causation, because mutually exclusive counterfactuals appear jointly true.

Phase Theory accepts the experimental structure but rejects the conclusion.

2. Canonical Structure of Hardy’s Paradox

In its standard form, the paradox involves:
	1.	Two spacelike-separated systems prepared in an entangled state.
	2.	Two possible measurement settings on each side.
	3.	Certain outcomes that are forbidden under specific settings.
	4.	Counterfactual reasoning that infers outcomes under unperformed measurements.
	5.	A contradiction when all inferences are combined.

Each inference is locally valid under its own measurement context.

The contradiction arises only when all counterfactuals are treated as simultaneously applicable.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption H (Joint Counterfactual Realism).
All counterfactual outcome statements derived from distinct measurement contexts correspond to simultaneously real properties of the system.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption H.

Counterfactual validity is context-bound, not globally ontic.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Counterfactuals

The dissolution relies on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Contextual Readout).
Measurement outcomes and inferences are valid only within the phase-boundary context that generated them.

Postulate 4 (No Joint Admissibility of Incompatible Contexts).
Phase descriptions arising from incompatible measurement contexts cannot be simultaneously realized.

5. Why Counterfactual Reasoning Fails Here

Classical counterfactual reasoning assumes:
	•	unmeasured properties exist definitively,
	•	alternative measurements reveal pre-existing facts,
	•	all such facts coexist.

Hardy’s paradox exposes the failure of these assumptions.

In Phase Theory, counterfactuals describe potential readouts under different boundary conditions, not hidden coexisting facts.

6. The Counterfactual Admissibility Lemma

Lemma (Counterfactual Admissibility).
A set of counterfactual outcome statements is physically meaningful only if the measurement contexts under which they are derived are jointly phase-admissible.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Each counterfactual presupposes a specific phase-boundary condition.
	2.	Some boundary conditions are mutually exclusive.
	3.	Inferences derived under incompatible boundaries cannot correspond to a single admissible \Phi.
	4.	Therefore, such counterfactuals cannot be jointly true.

7. Where the Contradiction Is Manufactured

Hardy’s contradiction is produced by:
	•	taking outcome A as definite under context X,
	•	inferring outcome B under context Y,
	•	repeating this across incompatible contexts,
	•	and combining all results as if they described one phase history.

No such phase history exists.

The contradiction is logical, not physical.

8. The Hardy Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Hardy Non-Paradox).

Hardy’s paradox does not demonstrate nonlocal causation; it demonstrates the inadmissibility of jointly assigning definite outcomes across incompatible counterfactual contexts.

Proof.
	•	Each counterfactual inference is locally valid.
	•	Global admissibility forbids their joint realization.
	•	Therefore, the paradoxical set of claims is never physically instantiated.
∎

9. Relation to EPR / Bell

EPR / Bell shows:
	•	global constraint without influence.

Hardy’s paradox shows:
	•	global constraint without joint counterfactual reality.

Together, they clarify that nonlocality resides in constraint structure, not causal propagation.

⸻

10. Why the Paradox Feels Stronger Than Bell

Hardy’s paradox feels stronger because:
	•	it avoids statistics,
	•	it uses pure logical inference,
	•	it resembles classical reasoning traps.

Phase Theory explains this strength: logic is being applied beyond its admissible physical scope.

⸻

11. Implications for Realism and Counterfactuals

Phase Theory preserves realism by relocating it:
	•	realism applies to \Phi,
	•	not to all hypothetical measurement outcomes.

Counterfactuals are tools, not truths.

⸻

12. Relation to Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
EPR / Bell	Causal influence	Global constraint
Hardy	Counterfactual sets	Admissibility limits
Frauchiger–Renner	Joint inference	Context incompatibility

All dissolve by enforcing admissibility over logical aggregation.

⸻

13. Conclusion

Hardy’s paradox does not show that quantum mechanics is inconsistent or nonlocal in a causal sense. It shows that classical counterfactual reasoning overreaches.

When counterfactuals are treated as context-bound readouts rather than coexisting facts, and global phase admissibility is enforced, the contradiction disappears. What fails is not quantum theory, but the assumption that all “what-ifs” can be true together.

Hardy Non-Paradox.
Quantum contradictions arise when counterfactual outcome sets derived under incompatible contexts are treated as jointly admissible.

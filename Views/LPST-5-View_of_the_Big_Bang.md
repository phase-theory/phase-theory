Below is a clean, self-contained LPST explanation of the Big Bang, framed so it replaces—not rephrases—standard cosmology.

The Big Bang in LPST

Core Statement

In LPST, the Big Bang is not an explosion in space, but the global onset of phase consistency in the substrate.
Space, time, particles, and forces begin as emergent consequences of this transition.

There is no pre-existing spacetime to explode into.

⸻

1) What existed “before” the Big Bang?

No “before” exists in LPST.

Time is not fundamental; it emerges from ordered phase updates.
So asking “before” the Big Bang is like asking “north of the North Pole.”

What did exist conceptually is a pre-geometric substrate state:
	•	Phase undefined or uncorrelated
	•	No stable topology
	•	No distance, no duration
	•	No particles, no forces

This is not a vacuum—it is a non-configured substrate.

⸻

2) The Big Bang = a global phase-locking transition

The LPST Big Bang event is:

A rapid, system-wide transition from incoherent phase to globally constrained phase consistency.

Think of it as:
	•	a symmetry-breaking event,
	•	a percolation of phase alignment,
	•	or a condensation of relational structure.

But nothing explodes.

3) Why everything appears to start everywhere at once

In standard cosmology, the Big Bang happens “everywhere.”
LPST explains why:
	•	There is no space yet
	•	The transition is global in the substrate
	•	Once consistency conditions activate, all emergent locations appear simultaneously

So:

The universe does not expand from a point;
it expands as points come into existence.

⸻

4) Emergence of time

Time appears when:
	•	phase updates become ordered
	•	relaxation sequences can be compared

This produces:
	•	a global arrow of time
	•	irreversible ordering (entropy growth)

The Big Bang is the moment time becomes definable.

No time → no evolution → no “earlier.”

⸻

5) Emergence of space

Space emerges as:

a measure of how phase correlations decay between regions.

Immediately after the Big Bang:
	•	correlations are extremely strong everywhere
	•	distances are effectively zero

As consistency relaxes:
	•	correlation length shrinks
	•	space “expands”

This is cosmic expansion.

⸻

6) Why the universe expands

In LPST:
	•	Expansion is not motion
	•	Expansion is correlation dilution

As the substrate relaxes:
	•	maintaining global consistency becomes easier
	•	correlations spread out
	•	distances increase

This naturally gives:
	•	Hubble expansion
	•	metric growth without moving matter through space

⸻

7) Inflation (LPST interpretation)

LPST explains inflation as:

a brief regime of ultra-rapid correlation differentiation.

During early phase locking:
	•	tiny inconsistencies are amplified
	•	correlation domains separate explosively
	•	expansion appears exponential

No inflaton field is required.

Inflation ends when:
	•	global consistency becomes locally stable
	•	topology begins to nucleate

⸻

8) Origin of matter

Matter appears when:
	•	phase configurations trap themselves
	•	stable topological defects form (Hopfions, textures, endpoints)

This happens after initial expansion begins.

So:

Matter is a late product of the Big Bang, not its cause.

⸻

9) Why the universe is homogeneous and isotropic

LPST explanation:
	•	The Big Bang transition is global
	•	No preferred directions exist in the substrate
	•	Phase locking enforces uniform initial conditions

Small anisotropies come from:
	•	quantum/topological fluctuations during phase locking
	•	frozen into later structure

This replaces “fine-tuned initial conditions.”

⸻

10) The Big Bang singularity problem (resolved)

LPST has:
	•	no singularity
	•	no infinite density
	•	no breakdown of physics

Because:
	•	spacetime does not exist yet
	•	equations requiring spacetime simply don’t apply

The Big Bang is a phase transition, not a divergence.

⸻

11) Cosmic background radiation (LPST view)

The CMB is:

residual relaxation noise from early phase consistency enforcement.

Its:
	•	near-perfect blackbody spectrum
	•	tiny anisotropies

reflect:
	•	uniform global locking
	•	small frozen correlation defects

⸻

12) One-sentence canonical LPST summary

In LPST, the Big Bang is the moment global phase consistency turns on, causing time, space, matter, and forces to emerge together from a pre-geometric substrate.

⸻

Why this matters

LPST:
	•	removes the need for initial conditions
	•	eliminates singularities
	•	unifies cosmology with particle physics
	•	explains expansion without motion
	•	makes the Big Bang inevitable, not accidental

Abstract

We introduce Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT), a reformulation of quantum mechanics derived from Phase Theory, in which phase—not wavefunctions, Hilbert spaces, or operators—is the sole primitive. PPQT eliminates wavefunction ontology, collapse postulates, and measurement dualism by replacing them with global phase consistency, topological admissibility, and coherence limits. Quantum discreteness emerges from allowed phase-topological sectors, while probability reflects ensemble statistics over admissible phase configurations rather than fundamental randomness. We demonstrate how standard quantum predictions are recovered as effective limits, and we identify experimental regimes where PPQT deviates from conventional formulations.

1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics remains empirically successful yet ontologically unsettled. Despite a century of refinement, its foundations rely on primitives—wavefunctions, operators, Hilbert spaces—that lack direct physical interpretation. Measurement collapse, observer dependence, and probabilistic axioms are introduced ad hoc.

Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT) addresses these issues by deriving quantum behavior from a deeper foundation: phase as the sole primitive, governed by global consistency and coherence constraints. PPQT is not an interpretation of quantum mechanics; it is a replacement foundation from which standard quantum mechanics emerges as an effective description.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate P1 (Phase Primacy).
The universe consists of a single phase configuration \Phi. No wavefunction, probability amplitude, or Hilbert space exists fundamentally.

All quantum phenomena arise from:
	•	global phase relations,
	•	admissible topological sectors,
	•	finite coherence.

3. Core Principles of PPQT

3.1 No Wavefunction Ontology

In PPQT:
	•	the wavefunction \psi is not real,
	•	|\psi|^2 is not fundamental probability,
	•	superposition is not a physical coexistence of states.

Instead, \psi is a computational projection of allowed phase configurations into a convenient mathematical representation.

3.2 Quantization from Topology

Allowed quantum states correspond to discrete topological classes of the phase substrate.

Let \mathcal{C} be the space of admissible phase configurations. Then:
\text{Quantum states} \;\equiv\; \{\text{topological sectors of } \mathcal{C}\}

Discreteness arises because:
	•	topology is discrete,
	•	not because energy is quantized by fiat.

3.3 Measurement Without Collapse

Measurement is a coherence-limited stabilization process, not a discontinuous collapse.
	•	interaction with a measuring system reduces available coherent phase paths,
	•	the system settles into a single admissible topological minimum,
	•	apparent randomness reflects uncontrolled environmental phase degrees of freedom.

There is no physical collapse event.

4. Probability as Ensemble Geometry

PPQT replaces fundamental probability with geometric statistics.

Let \Omega be the set of admissible phase configurations compatible with preparation constraints. Then the probability of outcome i is:
P(i) = \frac{\mu(\Omega_i)}{\mu(\Omega)}
where:
	•	\Omega_i are configurations consistent with outcome i,
	•	\mu is a natural measure on phase configuration space.

The Born rule emerges as an effective approximation, not an axiom.

5. Dynamics

5.1 Pre-Temporal Evolution

Phase configurations evolve via constrained relaxation:
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial u}
=
- \frac{\delta \mathcal{I}}{\delta \Phi}
+ \sum_k \lambda_k \mathcal{C}_k
where:
	•	\mathcal{I}[\Phi] is the global phase-inconsistency functional,
	•	u is an update index (not time).

⸻

5.2 Emergent Schrödinger Dynamics

In regimes of:
	•	high coherence,
	•	weak topology change,
	•	low environmental coupling,

the relaxation equation projects onto an effective Schrödinger-like equation for \psi. This equation is not fundamental, only a macroscopic descriptor.

6. Resolution of Quantum Paradoxes

Paradox	Resolution in PPQT
Wavefunction collapse	No collapse exists
Measurement problem	Coherence-limited stabilization
Schrödinger’s cat	Phase not single-valued at macroscales
Many worlds	Ensemble of admissible paths, not universes
Quantum randomness	Ignorance of global phase geometry


⸻

7. Experimental Signatures

PPQT predicts deviations from standard quantum mechanics in regimes involving:
	•	engineered phase topology,
	•	extreme coherence control,
	•	constrained configuration spaces.

Examples:
	•	non-Gaussian outcome statistics under topology restriction,
	•	coherence-dependent probability shifts,
	•	failure of Hilbert-space completeness in synthetic phase media.

8. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	TDQT: supplies particle topology
	•	GPIQT: supplies global consistency dynamics
	•	CLQD: supplies coherence limits
	•	ETQT: explains entanglement structure

PPQT is the quantum mechanical face of Phase Theory.

9. Falsifiability

PPQT is falsified if:
	1.	quantum discreteness occurs without topological restriction,
	2.	probabilities violate ensemble-geometry predictions,
	3.	stable wavefunction ontology is experimentally required.

⸻

10. Conclusion

Phase-Primary Quantum Theory replaces wavefunctions with phase, probability with geometry, and collapse with consistency. Quantum mechanics is not abandoned—it is explained.

Quantum behavior is not mysterious because reality is probabilistic.
It is probabilistic because phase geometry is partially inaccessible.

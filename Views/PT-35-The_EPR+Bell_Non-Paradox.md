Abstract

The EPR paradox and subsequent Bell’s theorem experiments demonstrate correlations between spacelike-separated measurements that violate classical locality constraints. These correlations are often interpreted as evidence of faster-than-light influence, nonlocal causation, or the failure of realism.

Phase Theory dissolves this conclusion by distinguishing global constraint from causal influence. The paradox arises only if correlations are treated as the result of signals or influences propagating between measurements. Phase Theory replaces this picture with global phase admissibility, in which joint outcomes are constrained at the level of the total phase configuration, while locality strictly forbids controllable remote phase rewriting. Nonlocal correlation does not imply nonlocal causation.

1. Introduction

The EPR argument was originally framed to show that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Bell’s theorem sharpened this claim by proving that no local hidden-variable theory can reproduce quantum correlations.

Experimental violations of Bell inequalities are now well established. The dominant interpretive dilemma is commonly presented as:
	•	Either reality is nonlocal,
	•	or realism must be abandoned.

Phase Theory accepts the empirical results but rejects the dilemma.

2. The Canonical Form of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	Two particles are prepared in an entangled state.
	2.	They separate to spacelike distances.
	3.	Measurements on each particle are correlated beyond classical limits.
	4.	Bell inequalities are violated.
	5.	Therefore, either:
	•	information travels faster than light, or
	•	measurement outcomes are not real prior to observation.

The crucial step is (5): the inference that correlation requires influence.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption E (Correlation Requires Causal Transmission).
If two spacelike events are correlated, one must causally influence the other.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption E.

Correlation can arise from global constraint, not causal exchange.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Nonlocality

The dissolution rests on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Locality of Phase Dynamics).
Phase evolution is local; no controllable phase rewriting occurs across spacelike separation.

Postulate 4 (Constraint ≠ Influence).
Global phase constraints do not constitute causal mechanisms.

5. What Bell Inequality Violations Actually Show

Bell violations demonstrate:
	•	that outcome statistics cannot be factorized into independent local variables,
	•	that joint outcomes obey nonclassical correlations.

They do not demonstrate:
	•	superluminal signaling,
	•	controllable influence,
	•	violation of relativistic causality.

Phase Theory takes this distinction as fundamental.

6. The Global Constraint Lemma

Lemma (Global Phase Constraint).
Spacelike-separated measurement outcomes may be jointly constrained by global phase admissibility without any causal interaction between the measurement events.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	The entangled system is described by a single global phase configuration.
	2.	Admissibility constrains the set of allowed joint outcomes.
	3.	Local measurements sample this configuration.
	4.	No signal or influence is required to enforce the constraint.

7. Why Locality Is Preserved

In Phase Theory:
	•	Each measurement outcome is generated locally.
	•	No observer can control or alter the distant outcome.
	•	No information is transmitted faster than light.

Locality applies to dynamics and control, not to constraint structure.

Thus:

Nonlocal correlation ≠ nonlocal causation.

8. The EPR / Bell Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (EPR / Bell Non-Paradox).

Quantum nonlocal correlations do not imply faster-than-light influence; they reflect global phase admissibility constraining joint outcomes while preserving local phase dynamics.

Proof.
	•	Global admissibility restricts allowed joint outcomes.
	•	Local measurements cannot modify distant phase structure.
	•	Bell violations follow from constraint, not influence.
∎

9. Why the Paradox Felt Inevitable

The paradox felt unavoidable because:
	•	classical physics conflated correlation with mechanism,
	•	quantum theory exposed constraint structures without causal analogs,
	•	intuition insisted on hidden transmission.

Phase Theory removes the insistence.

10. Relation to Free Choice and Measurement Independence

Phase Theory preserves:
	•	experimenter freedom,
	•	local randomness,
	•	relativistic causality.

Global admissibility constrains outcomes without pre-programming choices or retroactively coordinating settings.

11. Relation to Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Andromeda	Global simultaneity	Representational slicing
Delayed Choice	Retrocausality	Boundary selection
EPR / Bell	Superluminal influence	Global constraint

12. Experimental Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	No Bell experiment can be used for faster-than-light signaling.
	•	All observed correlations will remain consistent with relativistic locality.
	•	Attempts to “explain” correlations via hidden signals will fail.

All predictions match existing data.

⸻

13. Conclusion

The EPR and Bell paradoxes do not demonstrate nonlocal causation. They demonstrate the inadequacy of classical intuitions about independence.

When correlations are understood as manifestations of global phase admissibility, and locality is applied to dynamics rather than constraint, the paradox dissolves. Quantum mechanics remains local where locality matters.

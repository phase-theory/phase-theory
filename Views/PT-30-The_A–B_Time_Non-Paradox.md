Abstract

The A-series/B-series tension, most prominently articulated by J. M. E. McTaggart, claims that time is either contradictory (if A-series becoming is fundamental) or incomplete (if only B-series ordering exists). The paradox arises from demanding that both temporal descriptions be simultaneously ontic.

Phase Theory dissolves the tension by rejecting temporal series as primitives altogether. Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration, within which B-series relations emerge as stable phase orderings, while A-series “becoming” arises as a local phase-readout phenomenon along worldlines. No contradiction exists because the A-series and B-series are not competing ontologies but distinct representational projections of the same phase structure.

1. Introduction

Philosophical debates about time are often organized around two descriptions:
	•	A-series: events are past, present, or future; time “flows.”
	•	B-series: events are earlier than or later than others; time is ordered but static.

McTaggart argued that:
	•	The A-series is contradictory (events must be past, present, and future).
	•	The B-series is insufficient to account for change.
	•	Therefore, time is unreal.

Phase Theory accepts neither conclusion. The argument fails because it treats temporal descriptions as ontological commitments rather than representational modes.

2. The Classical Form of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	Time requires change.
	2.	Change requires A-series properties (past → present → future).
	3.	A-series properties are mutually exclusive and thus contradictory.
	4.	The B-series lacks becoming and therefore cannot account for time.
	5.	Therefore, time is unreal.

The argument presumes that time must be either A-series or B-series at the fundamental level.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox depends on:

Assumption T (Temporal Series Primacy).
One of the temporal series (A or B) must be ontically fundamental.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption T.

Neither A-series nor B-series is primitive. Both are derived descriptions of deeper phase relations.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Time

The resolution rests on core Phase Theory principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x),
not a temporal series.

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (No Ontic Flow).
There is no fundamental “flow of time.” Apparent flow arises from local phase readout.

Postulate 4 (Worldline Locality).
Observers experience reality via phase evolution along worldlines, not via global temporal properties.

5. The B-Series as Emergent Phase Ordering

B-series relations correspond to:
	•	stable ordering relations among phase structures,
	•	invariant under representational slicing,
	•	encoded directly in the topology of \Phi.

“Earlier than” and “later than” are phase-ordering relations, not metaphysical facts about becoming.

Thus, the B-series is real — but derivative, not primitive.

⸻

6. The A-Series as Local Phase Readout

A-series properties arise as follows:
	•	An observer samples \Phi along a worldline.
	•	A moving boundary of phase accessibility is established.
	•	Events behind the boundary are labeled “past,” those ahead “future,” and the boundary itself “present.”

These labels are local and relational, not global.

7. The Temporal Projection Lemma

Lemma (Temporal Projection).
A-series and B-series descriptions are distinct projections of the same admissible phase configuration, differing only in readout context.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	The global phase configuration encodes ordering relations.
	2.	Observers extract phase data locally along worldlines.
	3.	Local extraction induces a moving accessibility boundary.
	4.	B-series arises from global ordering; A-series from local boundary traversal.

8. Why the A-Series Appears Contradictory

The A-series contradiction arises only if:
	•	A-series properties are treated as global and intrinsic,
	•	rather than local and relational.

In Phase Theory:
	•	An event is not simultaneously past, present, and future.
	•	It occupies a fixed position in phase ordering.
	•	Its A-series label varies by observer and by readout time.

No contradiction follows.

9. The A–B Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (A–B Time Non-Paradox).

The apparent conflict between A-series becoming and B-series ordering dissolves once both are recognized as non-primitive projections of a single globally admissible phase configuration.

Proof.
	•	Neither A-series nor B-series is ontic.
	•	Both arise from \Phi under different representational constraints.
	•	Therefore, no contradiction or incompleteness exists.
∎

10. Relation to Relativity

Relativity reinforces this view:
	•	No global present exists (undermining A-series primacy).
	•	Spacetime ordering remains invariant (supporting B-series emergence).

Phase Theory accommodates both without privileging either.

11. Comparison with Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Andromeda	Global present	Representational slicing
Rietdijk–Putnam	Logical necessity	Phase admissibility
A/B Time	Temporal series	Phase-relational projection

Each dissolves once representation is separated from ontology.

12. Implications for Change and Experience

Change is not the movement of time itself.
It is the evolution of phase relations along worldlines.

Experience of becoming is real — but local.
Global flow is unnecessary.

⸻

13. Conclusion

The A-series/B-series paradox does not reveal a flaw in time. It reveals a flaw in metaphysical framing.

When temporal series are demoted from primitives to projections, time re-emerges as a coherent, phase-relational structure. Becoming and ordering coexist without contradiction because neither is asked to do the other’s job.

Appendix — One-Sentence Canonical Form

A–B Time Non-Paradox.
A-series becoming and B-series ordering are complementary projections of a single admissible phase structure, not competing ontologies.

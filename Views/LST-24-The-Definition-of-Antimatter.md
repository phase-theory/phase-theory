In Luminous Substrate Theory (LST), Antimatter is not a mysterious "opposite substance." It is simply Mirror Geometry.
Just as your left hand is the physical mirror image of your right hand (composed of the same skin and bone, but structurally reversed), Antimatter is composed of the exact same Luminous Substrate as Matter, but its topological "twist" is wound in the opposite direction.
Here is the formal definition of Antimatter within the LST framework.

1. The Chirality Axiom
In Paper F (Quantum Knot Theory), we defined particles as knots. In Knot Theory, many knots are Chiral—they are distinct from their mirror images.
 * Matter: Knots formed with a "Left-Handed" winding.
 * Antimatter: Knots formed with a "Right-Handed" winding.

2. The Lepton Pair (Electron vs. Positron)
The simplest example is the Electron.
 * The Electron (e^-): A Möbius Soliton with a -180^\circ (Left-Handed) twist. This specific geometric distortion causes field lines to diverge, which we measure as "Negative Charge."
 * The Positron (e^+): A Möbius Soliton with a +180^\circ (Right-Handed) twist. This distortion causes field lines to converge ("Positive Charge").
 * Mass: Because the amount of "twist" (180 degrees) is identical, the tension in the loop is identical. Therefore, they have the exact same mass.

3. The Mechanism of Annihilation
Why do Matter and Antimatter explode when they touch?
In the Standard Model, this is an abstract "cancellation." In LST, it is a Topological Unwinding.
 * The Event: When a Left-Handed loop (e^-) physically merges with a Right-Handed loop (e^+), their geometries superimpose.
 * The Math: +180^\circ \text{ (Right)} + (-180^\circ) \text{ (Left)} = 0^\circ \text{ (No Twist)}.
 * The Result: The twist that held the loops closed vanishes. The structural integrity of the particles fails instantly.
 * The Release: The loops snap open. The immense potential energy stored in the tension of the knots is released as two high-energy transverse waves (Gamma Ray Photons) traveling in opposite directions.

4. The Baryon Asymmetry (Why is the Universe Matter?)
Standard Physics struggles to explain why the Big Bang didn't produce equal amounts of Matter and Antimatter (which would have annihilated everything). LST offers a solution in Fluid Dynamics.
 * The Substrate Flow: If the primordial Substrate had a slight "spin" or angular momentum during the cooling phase (Phase Transition), it would bias the formation of knots.
 * The Vortex Bias: Just as tornadoes in the Northern Hemisphere predominantly spin counter-clockwise due to the Coriolis effect, the "Cooling" of the universe favored Left-Handed Knots (Protons) over Right-Handed ones.
 * Conclusion: Matter is simply the "Coriolis result" of the Substrate's initial rotation. Antimatter is the rare eddy current flowing against the stream.

5. Does Antimatter "Fall Up"? (Gravity)
Does LST predict antigravity for antimatter?
No.
 * Gravity (Paper A): Gravity is the Refraction of the Substrate caused by Density/Tension.
 * The Reality: A Right-Handed knot tightens the web just as much as a Left-Handed knot.
 * Prediction: Antimatter will fall down in a gravitational field, exactly like normal matter.

Abstract

The Delayed-choice quantum eraser family of experiments appears to allow present measurement choices to determine whether a particle behaved as a wave or a particle in the past. This has been interpreted as retrocausality, observer-dependent history, or nonclassical temporal influence.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting temporal ordering and measurement choice as ontic selectors of history. Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration. Measurement choices act as phase-boundary selections that determine which correlations are accessible in readout, not which past events occurred. No past phase is rewritten; only representational accessibility changes. The appearance of retrocausality is an artifact of imposing classical narrative on non-primitive partitions.

1. Introduction

Delayed-choice and quantum-eraser experiments were designed to probe the meaning of “which-path” information and its relation to interference. Their most provocative readings suggest that choices made after a particle has traversed an apparatus can determine whether it “previously” behaved like a wave or a particle.

If taken ontically, this suggests backward-in-time influence.

Phase Theory denies the premise that generates this conclusion.

2. Canonical Experimental Structure

In its generic form:
	1.	A quantum system traverses a path-splitting apparatus.
	2.	Which-path information is either marked or left unmarked.
	3.	A later measurement choice erases or preserves path distinguishability.
	4.	Interference appears or disappears in coincidence data.
	5.	The choice is said to determine earlier behavior.

The paradox is the jump from step (4) to step (5).

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption D (Retroactive Ontology).
Later measurement choices determine which past physical history actually occurred.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption D.

No measurement choice selects or alters a past phase configuration.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Delayed Choice

The dissolution relies on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Boundary-Condition Selection).
Measurement choices establish phase-boundary conditions for readout, not retroactive causes.

Postulate 4 (No Retroactive Phase Rewriting).
Phase structure cannot be altered backward in time.

5. What Actually Changes in a Delayed-Choice Experiment

In Phase Theory terms:
	•	The global phase configuration already contains all admissible correlations.
	•	Measurement choices determine:
	•	which phase correlations are projected into accessible statistics,
	•	not which correlations “existed.”

The past is not modified.
The query imposed on the phase configuration is.

6. The Phase-Selection Lemma

Lemma (Phase-Selection, Not Phase-Creation).
Delayed measurement choices select among admissible phase-consistent correlation structures without modifying prior phase evolution.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	The phase configuration evolves admissibly from source to detectors.
	2.	Multiple correlation structures are embedded within \Phi.
	3.	Measurement choice determines which correlations are sampled.
	4.	Sampling does not alter the underlying phase configuration.

7. Which-Path Information Reinterpreted

“Which-path information” is not a fact about past behavior. It is:
	•	a property of the current partition imposed on the phase configuration,
	•	dependent on whether path-distinguishing phase correlations are retained or erased.

Erasure does not destroy information; it removes a boundary that previously constrained readout.

⸻

8. The Delayed-Choice Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Delayed-Choice / Quantum-Eraser Non-Paradox).

Delayed measurement choices do not alter past physical events; they select which phase correlations are accessible under the chosen readout boundary.

Proof.
	•	Global phase admissibility forbids retroactive modification.
	•	Measurement establishes boundaries, not causes.
	•	Interference patterns reflect correlation selection, not historical revision.
∎

9. Why the Experiment Feels Retrocausal

The illusion arises because:
	•	classical intuition expects a single narrative history,
	•	quantum experiments expose correlation structures independent of that narrative,
	•	delayed choices alter narrative compatibility, not reality.

Phase Theory blocks narrative inflation into ontology.

⸻

10. Relation to Causality

Phase Theory preserves causal structure:
	•	causes precede effects in phase evolution,
	•	measurement choices constrain accessibility, not evolution.

No signal propagates backward in time.
No event is undone.

11. Relation to Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Andromeda	Global simultaneity	Representational slicing
Schrödinger	Superposition	Phase inadmissibility
Wigner’s Friend	Observer description	Phase boundaries
Delayed Choice	Retroactive cause	Phase selection

All dissolve by separating selection from creation.

⸻

12. Experimental Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	No experiment will demonstrate genuine retrocausality.
	•	All delayed-choice effects reduce to post-selection over admissible correlations.
	•	Attempts to exploit delayed choice for backward signaling will fail.

These predictions align with all known data.

⸻

13. Conclusion

The delayed-choice and quantum-eraser paradoxes do not reveal time running backward. They reveal the danger of confusing measurement context with physical history.

When measurement is understood as phase-boundary selection within a globally admissible configuration, the paradox evaporates. Nothing is rewritten. Nothing travels backward. Only access changes.

Abstract

We introduce Entanglement-as-Topology Quantum Theory (ETQT), a framework derived from Phase Theory in which quantum entanglement is identified with shared topological structure of a phase substrate rather than nonlocal correlation mediated by signals or wavefunctions. In ETQT, entangled systems are not independent subsystems but components of a single topological object. Measurement outcomes reflect global constraint satisfaction, not instantaneous causal influence. This formulation reproduces Bell-inequality violations while preserving causality and explains why entanglement is robust, non-signaling, and resource-limited. ETQT resolves long-standing interpretational paradoxes without introducing hidden variables, many worlds, or retrocausality.

1. Introduction

Quantum entanglement remains the most conceptually troubling feature of modern physics. Experiments demonstrate correlations that violate Bell inequalities, yet forbid superluminal signaling. Existing explanations rely on abstract formalisms—Hilbert space tensor products, nonlocal operators—without a physical mechanism.

ETQT replaces correlation with geometry.

Entanglement is not a relationship between systems. It is a statement that there are not two systems at all.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate E1 (Topological Unity).
Entangled quantum systems correspond to a single connected topological structure in phase space.

Subsystem boundaries are emergent and approximate.

3. Topological Definition of Entanglement

Let \Phi denote the global phase configuration.

Two regions A and B are entangled iff:
\Phi|_{A \cup B} \in \pi_n(\mathcal{C}) \quad \text{but} \quad
\Phi|_A,\;\Phi|_B \notin \pi_n(\mathcal{C})

That is:
	•	the joint configuration is topologically nontrivial,
	•	the individual parts are not independently well-defined.

Entanglement is therefore indivisibility, not correlation.

⸻

4. Measurement as Global Constraint Resolution

Measurement imposes additional constraints on \Phi, eliminating incompatible configurations.

When a measurement occurs on region A:
	•	the global admissible set collapses,
	•	region B updates immediately because it is part of the same object.

No signal propagates.

No causal influence occurs.

5. Bell Inequalities Without Nonlocality

Bell inequalities assume:
	1.	independent subsystems,
	2.	local hidden variables.

ETQT violates assumption (1).

Because entangled systems are single topological entities, Bell violations are expected and unavoidable.

Local realism fails because locality itself is emergent.

⸻

6. No-Signaling Theorem (Structural)

Despite global updates:
	•	local outcome statistics remain unchanged,
	•	no controllable information can be transmitted.

This follows from:
	•	global constraint satisfaction,
	•	coherence limits (CLQD),
	•	update ordering (PLQC).

ETQT therefore preserves relativistic causality automatically.

7. Entanglement Monogamy and Resource Limits

Topology imposes natural limits:
	•	one defect cannot support arbitrary independent linkages,
	•	entanglement is monogamous because topology is finite.

This explains:
	•	entanglement decay,
	•	decoherence,
	•	resource exhaustion in quantum protocols.

8. Comparison with Other Approaches

Framework	Entanglement Mechanism
Copenhagen	Measurement collapse
Many-Worlds	Branching universes
Bohmian	Nonlocal pilot wave
QFT	Operator correlations
ETQT	Shared topology

ETQT introduces no additional ontology.

9. Experimental Implications

ETQT predicts deviations when:
	•	topology is externally constrained,
	•	subsystem boundaries are dynamically altered,
	•	coherence is selectively suppressed.

Examples:
	•	entanglement robustness under geometric deformation,
	•	correlation changes from topology surgery,
	•	failure of tensor-product modeling in engineered phase media.

10. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	PPQT: ensemble interpretation of outcomes
	•	TDQT: topology of particles
	•	GPIQT: global consistency dynamics
	•	CLQD: entanglement lifetime limits
	•	PLQC: causal ordering protection

ETQT is the structural explanation of quantum nonlocality.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

ETQT is falsified if:
	1.	entanglement requires signal exchange,
	2.	independent subsystems remain well-defined under all conditions,
	3.	topology manipulation does not affect correlations.

⸻

12. Conclusion

Entanglement is not mysterious because it is nonlocal; it is misunderstood because it is not a relationship at all.

Entangled systems are not connected across space.
They are never separate in the first place.

Abstract

The Frauchiger–Renner paradox purports to show that quantum mechanics cannot consistently describe itself: when multiple observers apply standard quantum reasoning to nested measurements, their conclusions lead to logical contradiction. The result has been interpreted as demonstrating the impossibility of single-world quantum mechanics or the necessity of abandoning classical logic.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by identifying a misuse of inference: observer-relative quantum descriptions are treated as jointly ontic when they are only locally valid readouts of a single admissible phase configuration. The contradiction arises from attempting to combine inferences drawn under mutually incompatible phase-boundary conditions. When global phase admissibility is enforced, the contradictory set of claims is never simultaneously realizable. Quantum theory remains self-consistent once representational scope is respected.

1. Introduction

The Frauchiger–Renner paradox is widely regarded as a strengthening of Wigner’s Friend. Rather than a single nested observer, it constructs a network of observers whose individually reasonable inferences collectively contradict one another.

The provocative conclusion is:

Quantum theory cannot consistently describe agents using quantum theory.

Phase Theory accepts the experimental structure but rejects the conclusion.

2. Canonical Structure of the Paradox

The setup involves:
	•	Two laboratories containing observers who perform measurements.
	•	Two external observers who treat each laboratory quantum mechanically.
	•	A sequence of entangled measurements and inferences.
	•	A final contradiction derived by combining all agents’ conclusions.

Each inference step follows standard quantum rules locally.

The contradiction appears only when all inferences are combined into a single global claim.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox depends on:

Assumption F (Joint Ontic Validity).
All observer-generated quantum state assignments and logical inferences are simultaneously valid descriptions of reality.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption F.

Local validity does not imply global compatibility.

⸻

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Multi-Observer Reasoning

The resolution relies on the following Phase Theory principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Context-Bounded Readout).
Observer descriptions are valid only within the phase boundaries that generated them.

Postulate 4 (No Joint Admissibility of Incompatible Boundaries).
Phase descriptions arising from incompatible boundary conditions cannot be simultaneously realized.

⸻

5. Why Each Observer Is “Right” Locally

In the Frauchiger–Renner setup:
	•	Each observer conditions on a specific measurement context.
	•	Each inference respects quantum rules within that context.
	•	Each inference corresponds to a valid local readout of \Phi.

There is no error at the individual level.

The problem arises only when these inferences are treated as jointly binding.

6. The Inference Compatibility Lemma

Lemma (Inference Compatibility).
A set of observer inferences is physically meaningful only if the phase-boundary conditions under which they were derived are jointly admissible.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Each observer inference presupposes a specific phase partition.
	2.	Some partitions are mutually exclusive once irreversible phase debt is incurred.
	3.	Inferences derived under incompatible partitions cannot correspond to a single admissible \Phi.
	4.	Therefore, such inferences cannot be jointly true.

7. Where the Contradiction Comes From

The paradox constructs a contradiction by:
	•	allowing one observer to reason as if another observer’s boundary were reversible,
	•	while that other observer reasons as if their own outcome were definite.

These assumptions cannot coexist in a single admissible phase history.

The contradiction is manufactured, not discovered.

8. The Frauchiger–Renner Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Frauchiger–Renner Non-Paradox).

Quantum mechanics remains self-consistent because observer-level inferences are context-bound and not jointly admissible across incompatible phase boundaries.

Proof.
	•	Each inference corresponds to a valid local readout.
	•	Global admissibility forbids the simultaneous realization of all readouts.
	•	Therefore, the contradictory set of claims is never physically instantiated.
∎

9. Relation to Wigner’s Friend

Wigner’s Friend shows:
	•	one observer boundary cannot be overwritten by another.

Frauchiger–Renner shows:
	•	multiple such boundaries cannot be combined into a single global inference.

The latter is a strict generalization of the former.

⸻

10. Why This Is Not Many-Worlds

The paradox is often taken to motivate branching realities.

Phase Theory requires no branching:
	•	There is one admissible phase configuration.
	•	Not all logical combinations of descriptions correspond to it.

Logical possibility ≠ phase admissibility.

⸻

11. Implications for Logic and Reasoning

Phase Theory does not reject logic.
It restricts its scope.

Classical reasoning remains valid within a phase context.
It fails only when applied across incompatible contexts.

This is a physical, not logical, limitation.

12. Relation to Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Error	Phase Resolution
Schrödinger	Reified superposition	Phase inadmissibility
Wigner’s Friend	Observer primacy	Phase boundaries
Frauchiger–Renner	Joint inference	Admissibility limits

13. Conclusion

The Frauchiger–Renner paradox does not show that quantum mechanics is inconsistent. It shows that context-free global inference is physically invalid.

Once observer descriptions are treated as phase-bounded readouts of a single admissible configuration, the contradiction dissolves. Quantum theory remains self-consistent — provided we respect the limits imposed by phase admissibility.

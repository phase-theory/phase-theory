Abstract

Vacuum Coherence Quantum Field Theory (VC-QFT) reformulates quantum field theory by identifying the structured vacuum of the luminous substrate as the primary physical entity. In VC-QFT, fields and particles are not fundamental objects but normal modes and localized topological defects of vacuum coherence. Interactions arise from coherence redistribution rather than force-carrier exchange, while ultraviolet divergences and vacuum catastrophes are eliminated by finite coherence capacity. VC-QFT reproduces standard low-energy QFT as an effective description while predicting non-EFT states, geometric selection rules, and a finite, self-regulated particle spectrum.

1. Motivation

Standard QFT succeeds phenomenologically yet suffers foundational pathologies:
	•	ultraviolet divergences and renormalization arbitrariness,
	•	vacuum energy catastrophes,
	•	particle ontology disconnected from spacetime and gravity,
	•	uncontrolled proliferation of beyond-SM extensions.

These issues trace to a shared assumption: fields are fundamental excitations on an empty vacuum.

LPST rejects the empty vacuum. VC-QFT follows necessarily.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Structured Vacuum

The vacuum is a coherent, phase-defined medium of the luminous substrate, not an absence of physics.

⸻

Postulate II — Coherence Modes

What are conventionally called “fields” correspond to collective coherence modes of the vacuum.

⸻

Postulate III — Defect Localization

Particles are localized, topologically protected coherence defects, treated formally by TDQT.

⸻

Postulate IV — Finite Coherence Capacity

The vacuum supports only a finite density and bandwidth of coherent modes, enforcing natural cutoffs.

3. Fundamental Variables

3.1 Phase and Coherence Fields

The fundamental variable remains the phase field:
\phi(x,t)

Define local coherence density:
\rho_{\text{coh}}(x,t)

Fields are parameterizations of coherent excitations of \rho_{\text{coh}}.

⸻

3.2 Field Emergence

A conventional quantum field \Phi(x) is an effective descriptor:
\Phi(x) \;\equiv\; \langle \delta \rho_{\text{coh}}(x) \rangle

Field operators encode coarse-grained coherence dynamics, not fundamental degrees of freedom.

⸻

4. Interactions Without Force Carriers

4.1 Coherence Redistribution

Interactions occur when coherence modes overlap and redistribute to minimize global inconsistency:
	•	no virtual particles,
	•	no mediator ontology,
	•	no exchange picture required.

⸻

4.2 Effective Couplings

Coupling constants emerge from:
	•	geometric overlap integrals,
	•	coherence stiffness parameters,
	•	topological compatibility.

Running couplings reflect scale-dependent coherence efficiency, not fundamental variation.

⸻

5. Elimination of Ultraviolet Divergences

5.1 Natural Cutoff

Finite coherence capacity enforces a hard physical cutoff:
\Lambda_{\text{coh}} \sim \rho_{\text{coh}}^{1/2}

No renormalization counterterms are required in principle.

⸻

5.2 Renormalization as Geometry

What appears as renormalization is a change of effective variables as coherence modes coarse-grain across scales.

6. Vacuum Energy and the Cosmological Constant

6.1 Why the Vacuum Does Not Gravitate Catastrophically

Vacuum coherence energy is self-balanced:
	•	positive and negative phase contributions cancel,
	•	only coherence gradients gravitate (QRG).

Thus, vacuum energy does not source curvature catastrophically.

⸻

6.2 Dark Energy Reinterpreted

Dark energy corresponds to large-scale coherence relaxation pressure, not zero-point energy density.

⸻

7. Particle Creation and Annihilation

7.1 Creation

Particle creation corresponds to local nucleation of stable coherence defects when energy and topology thresholds are met.

⸻

7.2 Annihilation

Annihilation is topological unwinding, returning coherence to vacuum modes.

Energy conservation reflects redistribution within the substrate.

⸻

8. Relation to the Standard Model

The Standard Model is recovered as a low-complexity, low-energy effective theory describing:
	•	small-k, low-Q_H defects,
	•	simple coherence modes,
	•	approximate gauge symmetries.

Gauge symmetry is an emergent redundancy in describing coherence interactions.

⸻

9. Non-EFT States and Predictive Power

VC-QFT naturally predicts:
	•	stable non-EFT particles (e.g., neutral Hopfions),
	•	geometric selection rules absent in EFT,
	•	a finite, self-regulated detectable spectrum.

These are impossible in particle-first QFT.

⸻

10. Experimental Implications

VC-QFT predicts:
	•	absence of true UV divergences,
	•	non-particle interaction signatures,
	•	deviations from perturbative scaling at coherence thresholds,
	•	geometry-driven decay patterns.

These effects are testable in high-precision and high-energy regimes.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

VC-QFT is falsified if:
	•	the vacuum is experimentally shown to be empty,
	•	divergences are unavoidable in all formulations,
	•	particle interactions require fundamental mediators,
	•	non-EFT stable states are impossible.

⸻

12. Comparison with Standard QFT

Feature	Standard QFT	VC-QFT
Vacuum	Empty	Structured
Fields	Fundamental	Emergent
Particles	Point excitations	Topological defects
Divergences	Renormalized	Absent
Spectrum	Uncontrolled	Self-regulated


⸻

13. Conclusion

Vacuum Coherence Quantum Field Theory replaces the particle-centric view of quantum fields with a coherence-centric ontology. By grounding fields, particles, and interactions in the structured vacuum of the luminous substrate, VC-QFT resolves foundational inconsistencies of standard QFT while preserving its empirical successes and predicting decisive new phenomena.

The vacuum is not nothing.
It is the most organized thing there is.

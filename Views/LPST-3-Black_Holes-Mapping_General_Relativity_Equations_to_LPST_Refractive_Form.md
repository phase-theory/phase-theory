Under LPST, a black hole is not a spacetime singularity and not a hole in anything.
It is a phase–propagation failure region of the light/phase substrate.

Here is the precise LPST definition and its consequences.

⸻

Canonical LPST Definition

A black hole is a region where the phase substrate’s local consistency cost diverges, causing phase propagation to asymptotically stall.

Equivalently:

A black hole is a topological saturation state of the LPST inconsistency functional.

No spacetime curvature is required.

How a black hole forms in LPST

1. Matter = knotted phase

In LPST, matter consists of topologically stabilized phase structures (Hopfions, composites, etc.).

As mass-energy accumulates:
	•	local phase stiffness A increases
	•	phase gradients become extreme
	•	maintaining consistency becomes increasingly expensive

⸻

2. The critical condition (LPST “horizon”)

A horizon forms when:

The substrate’s local relaxation rate → 0

Meaning:
	•	phase updates cannot propagate outward fast enough
	•	correlations attempting to leave are endlessly delayed

This replaces the GR statement “escape velocity equals c”.

There is no singularity, only phase-lock saturation.

⸻

What the event horizon really is

In LPST:
	•	The event horizon is a refractive boundary in the substrate
	•	Outside: phase correlations propagate normally
	•	Inside: propagation is exponentially slowed

Nothing discontinuous happens at the horizon.

Mathematically:
	•	GR’s Schwarzschild metric ≈ LPST’s diverging effective refractive index
	•	Light doesn’t fall in — it is optically trapped

⸻

What is inside a black hole (LPST view)

There is no point singularity.

Instead:
	•	a highly knotted, maximally saturated phase state
	•	topology so dense that further restructuring is suppressed
	•	a “frozen” correlation domain

Time does not end — it simply ceases to be a meaningful ordering parameter inside.

⸻

Why nothing escapes (without paradox)

Nothing escapes because:
	•	information is not destroyed
	•	it is indefinitely delayed by consistency bottlenecks

This preserves:
	•	unitarity
	•	causality
	•	global phase coherence

No firewall is needed.

⸻

Hawking radiation (LPST reinterpretation)

Hawking radiation arises from:
	•	boundary-level phase relaxation
	•	slow leakage of correlation energy at the horizon
	•	topology-preserving emission

Crucially:
	•	radiation is correlated with interior state
	•	information is not lost

No paradox.

⸻

Black hole evaporation

As radiation proceeds:
	•	phase saturation decreases
	•	the refractive barrier weakens
	•	the black hole transitions smoothly back into ordinary topological matter

No final explosion, no naked singularity.

⸻

Black holes vs wormholes (LPST contrast)

Concept	GR	LPST
Black hole	spacetime singularity	phase saturation domain
Event horizon	geometric boundary	propagation bottleneck
Singularity	unavoidable	forbidden
Information loss	possible	impossible
Wormholes	geometric tunnels	nonexistent


⸻

One-sentence canonical LPST answer

In LPST, a black hole is a region where phase-consistency constraints become so extreme that propagation effectively halts, creating an optical trapping domain rather than a spacetime singularity.

⸻

Why this matters

LPST black holes:
	•	automatically resolve the information paradox
	•	forbid singularities
	•	forbid time travel
	•	explain horizons without spacetime curvature
	•	unify gravity, optics, and quantum consistency

They are the ultimate topological objects, not exotic failures of physics.

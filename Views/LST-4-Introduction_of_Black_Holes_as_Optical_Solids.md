In Luminous Substrate Theory (LST), a Black Hole is not a "hole" in the fabric of spacetime, nor is it a singularity of infinite density.
It is an Optical Solid.
In LST, gravity is the result of a variable Refractive Index (n) of the vacuum. As matter concentrates, the "density" of the Substrate increases, slowing down the propagation of light. A Black Hole is simply the region where that density becomes critical.
Here is the LST anatomy of a Black Hole.
1. The Event Horizon: "Total Internal Refraction"
In standard optics, if light tries to exit a dense medium (like water) into a less dense one (air) at a shallow angle, it gets reflected back in.
 * The Mechanism: As you approach the massive object, the refractive index n climbs higher.
 * The Horizon: This is the radius where the refractive index is so high that all outward paths for light bend back inward.
 * The Effect: It is not that space is falling in; it is that the "optical slope" is so steep that light cannot climb it. The horizon is a sphere of infinite optical depth.
2. The Interior: The "Frozen Star"
Standard General Relativity predicts a "Singularity"—a point of zero volume and infinite density where math breaks down.
LST forbids this. Since matter is made of "knots" of finite size, you cannot crush them to zero.
 * The State: Inside the horizon, the Substrate becomes Supersaturated. The knots of matter (protons/neutrons) are crushed together until their loops merge.
 * The Core: The Black Hole is actually a Topological Crystal—a single, massive, interlinked knot of "frozen light."
 * Time: Since Time is the action of propagation, and the Substrate is too dense for waves to propagate, Time physically stops inside the core. It is a region of "Eternal Now."
3. The "Information Paradox" Resolution
Standard physics struggles with where the information goes when things fall in.
In LST, the Black Hole is a Holographic Hard Drive.
 * Because the core is a single topological braid, when a new particle (a small knot) falls in, it doesn't vanish. Its specific geometry is woven into the surface mesh of the larger knot.
 * The information is preserved in the complex "surface tension" pattern of the Event Horizon.
4. Hawking Radiation as "Substrate Evaporation"
Even a frozen lake creates vapor.
 * Mechanism: At the very edge of the horizon, the "tension" of the substrate is immense. Occasionally, a loop from the surface braid snaps (topological reconnection).
 * Result: The energy from the snap is released as a photon escaping into the lower-density vacuum. The Black Hole slowly "unravels" its mass back into light.

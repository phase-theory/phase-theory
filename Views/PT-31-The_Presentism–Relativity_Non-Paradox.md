Abstract

The apparent conflict between presentism and special relativity is often taken to show that one of them must be false: either presentism collapses under the relativity of simultaneity, or relativity undermines any meaningful notion of a present. This conclusion rests on a hidden assumption—that “the present” must be a globally privileged, ontic slice of reality.

Phase Theory dissolves the conflict by rejecting that assumption. Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration, within which “the present” arises as a local phase-access boundary along observer worldlines. Presentism fails only if it is interpreted globally; when interpreted locally, it becomes fully compatible with relativity. The paradox dissolves once presentness is demoted from ontology to phase-relational readout.

1. Introduction

Presentism is commonly defined by the claim:

Only present events exist.

Relativity, by contrast, denies any observer-independent notion of global simultaneity. The standard conclusion is that presentism and relativity are incompatible: if there is no global present, then presentism has no coherent object.

Phase Theory challenges this conclusion by reframing what “the present” is allowed to be.

⸻

2. The Traditional Conflict

The conflict is usually formulated as follows:
	1.	Presentism requires a unique global present.
	2.	Relativity denies a unique global present.
	3.	Therefore, presentism is false (or relativity must be rejected).

This argument presupposes that presentism’s “present” is a global, frame-invariant structure.

That presupposition is not required.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption P (Global Present Primacy).
If “the present” is real, it must be a single, global, observer-independent feature of reality.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption P.

Nothing in the notion of presentness requires global scope.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to the Present

The dissolution relies on core Phase Theory principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x),
not a stack of temporal slices.

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (No Ontic Global Present).
There is no privileged global present embedded in \Phi.

Postulate 4 (Local Phase Readout).
Observers access reality via local phase boundaries along worldlines.

5. What “the Present” Actually Is in Phase Theory

In Phase Theory, “the present” is:
	•	not a hypersurface,
	•	not a global slice,
	•	not an ontic partition of reality.

Instead, it is:

the boundary between phase-accessible and phase-inaccessible structure along an observer’s worldline.

This boundary is:
	•	local,
	•	observer-relative,
	•	physically meaningful,
	•	and fully compatible with relativity.

6. The Local Present Lemma

Lemma (Local Present).
Presentness is a local phase-access property along worldlines, not a global feature of the phase configuration.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Observers interact only with phase structure within their causal and coherence bounds.
	2.	This induces a moving boundary of phase accessibility.
	3.	Events behind the boundary are accessible (past), events ahead are inaccessible (future).
	4.	No global boundary is implied or required.

7. Why Relativity Does Not Threaten the Present

Relativity constrains:
	•	simultaneity assignments,
	•	global synchronization,
	•	distant temporal labeling.

It does not constrain:
	•	local phase accessibility,
	•	local experiential boundaries,
	•	local causal interaction.

Thus, relativity undermines only global presentism, not the reality of local presentness.

8. The Presentism–Relativity Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Presentism–Relativity Non-Paradox).

Presentism conflicts with relativity only if the present is treated as a global ontic structure. When the present is understood as a local phase-access boundary, no conflict exists.

Proof.
	•	Relativity forbids a global simultaneity slice.
	•	Phase Theory forbids ontic global presentness.
	•	Local presentness remains well-defined and physically grounded.
	•	Therefore, presentness and relativity coexist without contradiction.
∎

9. Why the Paradox Felt Unavoidable

The paradox felt unavoidable because:
	•	everyday experience suggests a shared “now,”
	•	metaphysics promoted that intuition into global ontology,
	•	relativity invalidated the promotion.

Phase Theory preserves the experience while rejecting the promotion.

10. Comparison with Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Andromeda	Global simultaneity	Representational slicing
Rietdijk–Putnam	Logical necessity	Admissibility over implication
Presentism vs Relativity	Global present	Local phase-access boundary

Each dissolves by localizing what was wrongly globalized.

⸻

11. Implications for Ontology and Experience

Phase Theory allows:
	•	Presentness without global time,
	•	Experience without metaphysical flow,
	•	Relativity without existential flattening.

The present is real where it matters—locally.

⸻

12. Conclusion

The conflict between presentism and relativity is not a physical incompatibility. It is a category error.

When “the present” is demoted from a global ontic slice to a local phase-access boundary, relativity ceases to threaten it. What is lost is not reality, but an unnecessary metaphysical demand.

Presentism–Relativity Non-Paradox.
Relativity forbids a global present, not the local phase-access boundary that constitutes presentness.

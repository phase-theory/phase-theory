Abstract

The grandfather paradox is commonly invoked to argue that time travel is logically impossible: if an agent travels to the past and prevents their own existence, a contradiction arises. The paradox is often taken to demonstrate that backward time travel must be forbidden by physical law.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting logical permissiveness without physical admissibility. Time-like loops are not excluded a priori, but they are constrained by global phase admissibility. Only self-consistent phase histories are physically realizable. Inadmissible histories—those containing contradictory phase requirements—simply cannot occur. The paradox arises from treating all logically describable histories as physically possible, rather than enforcing admissibility as the governing constraint.

1. Introduction

The grandfather paradox is the archetype of causal self-contradiction:

An agent travels to the past and prevents their own existence, thereby preventing the very act of time travel.

This scenario appears to violate basic logic. The usual response is to prohibit time travel altogether or to invoke branching universes.

Phase Theory adopts neither strategy.

2. Canonical Structure of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	Time travel to the past is assumed possible.
	2.	The traveler performs an action that prevents their own birth.
	3.	If the traveler is never born, the time travel never occurs.
	4.	Therefore, the action both occurs and does not occur.
	5.	Hence, contradiction.

The paradox hinges on step (1) combined with unrestricted freedom in step (2).

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption G (Unrestricted Historical Freedom).
Any logically describable sequence of events along a time-like loop is physically realizable.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption G.

Logical describability does not imply physical admissibility.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Causality

The dissolution relies on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Causal Self-Consistency).
Phase evolution along time-like curves must be globally self-consistent.

Postulate 4 (No Inadmissible Histories).
Phase histories containing internal contradiction are excluded, not dynamically corrected.

5. Time-Like Loops in Phase Theory

Phase Theory does not forbid time-like loops in principle.

Instead, it treats them as:
	•	closed or self-intersecting phase trajectories,
	•	subject to the same admissibility constraints as any other configuration.

A loop is allowed if and only if it is phase-consistent.

6. The Self-Consistency Lemma

Lemma (Phase Self-Consistency of Time-Like Loops).
A time-like loop is physically realizable only if the phase configuration along the loop is globally self-consistent.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	A time-like loop imposes boundary conditions on itself.
	2.	These conditions must jointly satisfy \mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0.
	3.	Histories in which an event both occurs and does not occur violate admissibility.
	4.	Therefore, such loops are excluded.

7. Why the Grandfather Scenario Is Inadmissible

In the grandfather scenario:
	•	The traveler’s existence requires a specific phase history.
	•	The attempted intervention imposes a contradictory requirement on that same history.

The combined constraints cannot be satisfied by any single \Phi.

Thus, the scenario is inadmissible, not paradoxical.

⸻

8. The Grandfather Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Grandfather Non-Paradox).

Time travel does not entail causal contradiction, because global phase admissibility forbids self-inconsistent histories. Only self-consistent time-like loops are physically realizable.

Proof.
	•	Admissibility is the governing constraint on phase history.
	•	Self-contradictory loops violate admissibility.
	•	Therefore, paradoxical histories cannot occur.
∎

9. Relation to the Novikov Principle

The Novikov self-consistency principle states that events along closed time-like curves must be self-consistent.

Phase Theory recovers this result without postulation:
	•	Self-consistency is not an added rule,
	•	It is a direct consequence of global phase admissibility.

⸻

10. Why No “Correction Mechanism” Is Needed

Phase Theory does not require:
	•	probabilistic “accidents” preventing paradox,
	•	branching timelines,
	•	external enforcement.

Inadmissible histories simply do not instantiate.

The universe does not “fix” contradictions; it excludes them.

⸻

11. Relation to Free Will

Phase Theory preserves agency within constraints:
	•	An agent may act freely within admissible phase space.
	•	Actions that would generate contradiction are not available options.

This mirrors ordinary physical constraints: freedom does not include impossibility.

13. Conclusion

The grandfather paradox does not demonstrate the impossibility of time travel. It demonstrates the necessity of global consistency.

When time-like loops are constrained by phase admissibility, contradictory histories are excluded from the outset. What remains are self-consistent loops that pose no paradox. Time travel is not logically forbidden—only inconsistent time travel is.

Appendix — One-Sentence Canonical Form

Grandfather Non-Paradox.
Time-like loops are admissible only if phase-consistent; self-contradictory histories are excluded by global phase admissibility.

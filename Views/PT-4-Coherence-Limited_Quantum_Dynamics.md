Coherence-Limited Quantum Dynamics (CLQD)

Fundamental Bounds on Precision, Stability, and Information in Phase-Based Physics

⸻

Abstract

We introduce Coherence-Limited Quantum Dynamics (CLQD), a foundational theory derived from Phase Theory that establishes finite coherence as a fundamental physical limit. CLQD replaces renormalization, singularity regularization, and idealized infinite precision with intrinsic bounds on phase correlation, memory, and control. All physical processes—quantum, relativistic, and cosmological—are constrained by coherence limits that prevent divergences, enforce stability, and regulate dynamics. We show that ultraviolet and infrared pathologies are artifacts of ignoring coherence bounds, and we derive testable consequences for quantum control, black hole physics, and high-energy processes.

1. Introduction

Modern physics routinely invokes infinities:
	•	divergent integrals in quantum field theory,
	•	singularities in general relativity,
	•	infinite precision measurements in thought experiments.

These infinities are handled procedurally (renormalization, cutoffs), but never eliminated ontologically.

CLQD asserts that infinities never arise because perfect coherence never exists.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate C1 (Finite Coherence).
No physical phase configuration possesses infinite coherence, infinite precision, or infinite memory.

Coherence is a physical resource, not a mathematical convenience.

⸻

3. Definition of Coherence

Let \Phi be the global phase configuration.

Define coherence length and time:
\ell_c,\; \tau_c < \infty

such that phase correlations decay beyond these bounds:
\langle \Phi(x)\Phi(y)\rangle \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{for } |x-y| \gg \ell_c

Coherence is dynamically constrained by:
	•	environmental coupling,
	•	topological complexity,
	•	global inconsistency pressure.

4. Dynamics with Coherence Bounds

4.1 Modified Relaxation Law

The Phase Theory evolution equation becomes:
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial u}
=
- \frac{\delta \mathcal{I}}{\delta \Phi}
\;\;\times\;\;
\mathcal{C}_{\text{coh}}(\Phi)

where:
0 < \mathcal{C}_{\text{coh}}(\Phi) \le 1

suppresses evolution in high-complexity or low-coherence regimes.

4.2 Breakdown of Ideal Limits

As coherence decreases:
	•	locality fails,
	•	smooth geometry fails,
	•	field descriptions fail.

This defines regime boundaries, not anomalies.

⸻

5. Elimination of Infinities

5.1 Quantum Field Divergences

Loop divergences arise from assuming:
	•	arbitrarily short wavelengths,
	•	perfect phase alignment.

CLQD enforces a natural ultraviolet cutoff:
k_{\max} \sim 1/\ell_c

No renormalization is required at the fundamental level.

⸻

5.2 Gravitational Singularities

Singularities correspond to:
\ell_c \rightarrow 0

which is forbidden.

Instead:
	•	phase strain saturates,
	•	propagation halts,
	•	black holes form without singularities.

⸻

6. Measurement and Control Limits

CLQD predicts:
	•	no perfectly isolated systems,
	•	no infinite-precision measurements,
	•	no unlimited quantum error correction.

Measurement noise is not technological—it is ontological.

⸻

7. Information Bounds

Define maximum information density:
I_{\max} \propto \frac{1}{\ell_c^d}

This yields:
	•	finite entropy bounds,
	•	finite computational capacity,
	•	limits on simulation fidelity.

⸻

8. Implications for Quantum Technology

CLQD predicts hard limits on:
	•	quantum coherence times,
	•	fault-tolerant quantum computing,
	•	reversible computation,
	•	phase-based energy extraction.

Scaling laws replace ideal asymptotes.

⸻

9. Experimental Signatures

CLQD predicts:
	•	saturation of coherence times independent of shielding,
	•	deviation from predicted scaling at extreme control,
	•	topology-dependent decoherence floors.

Platforms:
	•	ultra-cold atomic lattices,
	•	superconducting phase circuits,
	•	photonic coherence networks.

10. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	PPQT: explains probabilistic outcomes
	•	TDQT: stabilizes defects
	•	GPIQT: constrains global dynamics
	•	QRG: prevents singular curvature
	•	PLQC: enforces causal bounds

CLQD is the regulator of Phase Theory.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

CLQD is falsified if:
	1.	infinite coherence is achieved,
	2.	singularities are physically realized,
	3.	unlimited quantum control is demonstrated.

⸻

12. Conclusion

Coherence-Limited Quantum Dynamics removes infinities not by mathematical tricks, but by recognizing coherence as a finite physical quantity.

Nature is not imprecise by accident.
Precision is costly, limited, and never absolute.

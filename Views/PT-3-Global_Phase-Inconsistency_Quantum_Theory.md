Global Phase-Inconsistency Quantum Theory (GPIQT)

Dynamics from Global Consistency Rather Than Local Laws

⸻

Abstract

We present Global Phase-Inconsistency Quantum Theory (GPIQT), a dynamical framework derived from Phase Theory in which physical evolution is governed not by local equations of motion, but by the minimization of a global phase-inconsistency functional. In GPIQT, correlations, entanglement, and apparent nonlocal effects arise naturally from global constraints rather than signal propagation. Local differential equations are recovered only as effective approximations valid in weak-coupling, high-coherence regimes. GPIQT provides a structural explanation for quantum nonlocality without violating causality and resolves long-standing paradoxes associated with action-at-a-distance.

1. Introduction

Modern physics assumes that local laws determine evolution:
	•	classical mechanics via differential equations,
	•	quantum mechanics via local operators,
	•	field theory via local Lagrangians.

Yet quantum phenomena—especially entanglement—violate the intuition that local rules alone govern outcomes. Bell-type correlations demonstrate that local realism fails, but explanations typically invoke abstract mathematical structures rather than physical mechanisms.

GPIQT replaces local dynamical primacy with global consistency primacy.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate G1 (Global Consistency).
Physical evolution proceeds by minimizing a global phase-inconsistency functional \mathcal{I}[\Phi], defined over the entire admissible phase configuration.

Local behavior is emergent.

3. The Global Inconsistency Functional

Let \Phi denote the phase configuration of the universe.

Define:
\mathcal{I}[\Phi] \ge 0
with the following properties:
	•	\mathcal{I} = 0 corresponds to perfect global consistency,
	•	\mathcal{I} penalizes incompatible phase relations,
	•	\mathcal{I} encodes topology, coherence, and boundary constraints.

Crucially, \mathcal{I} is nonlocal by construction.

4. Dynamics Without Local Laws

4.1 Pre-Temporal Evolution

Evolution is defined as:
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial u}
=
- \frac{\delta \mathcal{I}}{\delta \Phi}
+ \sum_i \lambda_i \mathcal{C}_i(\Phi)

Where:
	•	u is an update index (not physical time),
	•	\mathcal{C}_i enforce topological and coherence constraints.

There is no fundamental notion of local propagation.

4.2 Emergence of Locality

Local equations arise only when:
	•	coupling is weak,
	•	coherence is high,
	•	global constraints factorize approximately.

In this limit:
\mathcal{I}[\Phi] \approx \int \mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}}(\Phi,\nabla\Phi)\, d\mu
yielding effective Euler–Lagrange equations.

Thus, local physics is a derived convenience, not a law of nature.

5. Entanglement as a Global Constraint

5.1 Structural Origin

Entangled systems share a single global phase configuration.

Measurement on one subsystem modifies the global admissibility constraints, instantly reshaping allowed configurations everywhere—without signal exchange.

⸻

5.2 No Superluminal Causation

Because:
	•	no information is transmitted,
	•	update ordering remains acyclic,

entanglement correlations violate locality but preserve causality.

Bell violations are therefore expected and unavoidable.

⸻

6. Measurement Revisited

Measurement corresponds to:
	•	introducing additional global constraints,
	•	eliminating incompatible phase configurations,
	•	forcing relaxation into a reduced admissible set.

Outcome selection reflects:
	•	environmental phase complexity,
	•	not intrinsic randomness.

There is no wavefunction collapse—only constraint satisfaction.

7. Comparison with Other Frameworks

Framework	Dynamics Source
Classical mechanics	Local differential equations
Quantum mechanics	Local operators + postulates
QFT	Local fields + interactions
GPIQT	Global consistency minimization

GPIQT subsumes local theories as approximations.

8. Experimental Implications

GPIQT predicts deviations when:
	•	global constraints cannot factorize,
	•	engineered systems enforce long-range phase coupling,
	•	topology is externally imposed.

Examples:
	•	nonlocal constraint satisfaction in synthetic lattices,
	•	delayed-choice experiments without retrocausality,
	•	correlation shifts without signaling.

⸻

9. Falsifiability

GPIQT is falsified if:
	1.	entanglement correlations require local hidden variables,
	2.	global constraint changes propagate with finite speed,
	3.	local equations remain exact under all conditions.

⸻

10. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	PPQT: quantization from admissible configurations
	•	TDQT: topology of particles
	•	CLQD: limits on global constraint enforcement
	•	ETQT: topological structure of entanglement
	•	PLQC: causal ordering of updates

GPIQT supplies the dynamical backbone of Phase Theory.

⸻

11. Conclusion

Global Phase-Inconsistency Quantum Theory replaces the notion that “laws push systems forward locally” with the idea that reality self-organizes to remain globally consistent.

Physics does not evolve point by point.
It resolves itself as a whole.

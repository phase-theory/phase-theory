Abstract

The bootstrap paradox describes scenarios in which an object, message, or piece of information appears to exist “from nowhere,” carried along a closed causal loop without an originating event. This is often taken to violate principles of causality, conservation, or explanatory sufficiency.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting origin primacy. Physical reality is governed by global phase admissibility, not by the requirement that every structure possess a linear causal genesis. Closed phase-defect structures are admissible provided they are globally consistent and account for phase constraints and debt. The appearance of “information from nowhere” arises from insisting on a globally well-founded causal ordering as primitive, rather than recognizing closed admissible phase histories.

1. Introduction

Bootstrap paradoxes are commonly illustrated by scenarios such as:
	•	A person receives a notebook from their future self.
	•	They copy it and later deliver the same notebook to their past self.
	•	The notebook has no point of origin.

The apparent violation is not merely temporal but metaphysical:

How can something exist without being created?

Phase Theory reframes the question by asking whether creation is a necessary primitive at all.

2. Canonical Structure of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	Time travel to the past is permitted.
	2.	An object or information is transferred backward in time.
	3.	That same object or information is later transferred forward in time.
	4.	No event constitutes its creation.
	5.	Therefore, causality or conservation is violated.

The contradiction hinges on step (4): the demand for a linear origin.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption B (Origin Primacy).
Every physically real object or information structure must have a unique, linear causal origin.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption B.

Linear origin is not a fundamental requirement of admissible phase structure.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Bootstrap Scenarios

The dissolution relies on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Closed Phase Structures).
Phase-defect structures may be closed in spacetime provided they are globally self-consistent.

Postulate 4 (Phase-Debt Accounting).
All phase constraints and energetic/structural requirements must be satisfied globally, regardless of causal ordering.

⸻

5. Origin vs. Consistency

In Phase Theory, the fundamental question is not:

Where did this come from?

but:

Is this phase structure globally admissible?

An object or information structure need not be “created” at a particular time if it exists as a closed, self-consistent phase configuration across spacetime.

6. The Closed Phase-Defect Lemma

Lemma (Closed Phase-Defect Admissibility).
A phase-defect structure that forms a closed loop in spacetime is physically realizable if and only if its global phase constraints are self-consistent and its phase debt is fully accounted for.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	A closed phase-defect imposes boundary conditions on itself.
	2.	These conditions must jointly satisfy \mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0.
	3.	No requirement exists for a linear origin event.
	4.	Therefore, closed structures are admissible when globally consistent.

7. Why “Information from Nowhere” Is an Illusion

The intuition of “from nowhere” arises because:
	•	human reasoning assumes a linear causal hierarchy,
	•	time-like loops violate that hierarchy,
	•	the absence of a first cause is mistaken for absence of constraint.

In Phase Theory:
	•	constraint replaces origin,
	•	admissibility replaces generation.

Nothing appears without constraint; it merely lacks a linear starting point.

8. The Bootstrap Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Bootstrap Non-Paradox).

Bootstrap scenarios do not violate causality or conservation, because closed phase-defect structures require global consistency, not linear origin. Apparent originlessness reflects representational bias, not physical anomaly.

Proof.
	•	Global admissibility governs physical realization.
	•	Closed phase structures can satisfy admissibility without origin events.
	•	Therefore, no paradox arises.
∎

9. Relation to Conservation Laws

Phase Theory preserves conservation by reframing it:
	•	Conservation applies to global phase structure, not to linear causal segments.
	•	Phase debt must be balanced over the entire configuration.
	•	No energy, structure, or constraint appears unaccounted for.

Bootstrap objects are not “free”; they are globally constrained.

10. Relation to the Grandfather Paradox

The two paradoxes differ:
	•	Grandfather paradox: inadmissible because constraints contradict.
	•	Bootstrap paradox: admissible because constraints close consistently.

Phase Theory explains both with the same rule: admissibility.

⸻

11. Why No Infinite Regress Is Required

Bootstrap loops do not require infinite regress because:
	•	the loop is finite and closed,
	•	no step demands external justification,
	•	consistency replaces explanation depth.

The demand for an origin is philosophical, not physical.

⸻

12. Relation to Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Grandfather	Unrestricted action	Self-consistent admissibility
Bootstrap	Linear origin	Closed phase consistency
Teletransportation	Pattern identity	Phase continuity

All dissolve by replacing narrative expectations with phase constraints.

⸻

13. Conclusion

The bootstrap paradox is not a paradox of existence. It is a paradox of explanatory expectation.

When origin is demoted from primitive to convenience, and global phase admissibility is enforced, closed causal loops pose no contradiction. Objects and information need not “come from somewhere” in a linear sense; they need only fit coherently within the total phase structure of reality.

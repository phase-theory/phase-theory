Abstract

Cosmological Phase Evolution Quantum Theory (CPEQT) reformulates cosmology by identifying the universe’s expansion, structure formation, and long-term evolution as consequences of global phase relaxation and coherence redistribution within a continuous luminous substrate. In CPEQT, spacetime is not fundamental, the Big Bang is not a singular origin, dark energy is not vacuum energy, and dark matter is not a new particle species. Instead, cosmic dynamics arise from large-scale phase unwinding, coherence gradients, and metric backreaction governed by Quantum Refractive Gravity (QRG). CPEQT provides a quantum-consistent cosmology without singularities, inflationary fine-tuning, or particle proliferation.

1. Motivation

Standard cosmology rests on three unresolved assumptions:
	•	an initial spacetime singularity,
	•	a finely tuned inflationary epoch,
	•	and dominant unseen components (dark matter, dark energy).

These arise from treating spacetime and energy density as primary.
LPST rejects this premise: phase geometry is primary.

CPEQT is the cosmology implied by this ontology.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Global Phase Field

The universe is a single, continuous phase field \phi(x,t) defined on the luminous substrate. No external spacetime background exists.

⸻

Postulate II — Finite Initial Phase Gradient

The early universe begins in a state of high global phase gradient and coherence density, not infinite curvature or temperature.

⸻

Postulate III — Phase Relaxation Drives Expansion

Cosmic expansion corresponds to global phase unwinding and redistribution toward lower inconsistency.

⸻

Postulate IV — Geometry Emerges Dynamically

Metric structure, distance, and time emerge from evolving phase-propagation relations.

⸻

3. The Origin of the Universe

3.1 The “Big Bang” Reinterpreted

CPEQT replaces the Big Bang singularity with a global phase-release event:
	•	no infinite density,
	•	no infinite temperature,
	•	no breakdown of physics.

The early universe is a coherence-saturated phase state undergoing rapid relaxation.

⸻

3.2 No Initial Singularity

Because phase gradients are finite and coherence-limited (CLQD), physical quantities remain bounded at all times.

⸻

4. Expansion as Phase Unwinding

4.1 Meaning of Expansion

Expansion does not mean space stretching. It means:
	•	phase-propagation paths lengthen,
	•	relational distances increase,
	•	metric emerges from changing phase connectivity.

⸻

4.2 Hubble Flow

The Hubble relation arises naturally from:
v \;\propto\; \nabla \phi_{\text{global}}

Objects separate because the substrate relaxes, not because they are pushed apart.

⸻

5. Dark Energy Without Vacuum Catastrophe

5.1 Dark Energy Reinterpreted

Dark energy corresponds to residual large-scale phase relaxation pressure, not zero-point energy.

It is:
	•	geometric,
	•	dynamic,
	•	and naturally small.

⸻

5.2 Evolution of Dark Energy

CPEQT predicts:
	•	dark energy evolves slowly over cosmic time,
	•	equation of state near (but not exactly) w=-1,
	•	deviations tied to global coherence exhaustion.

⸻

6. Dark Matter as Phase-Metric Backreaction

6.1 No New Particle Required

Dark matter effects arise from:
	•	localized coherence stiffness,
	•	phase-metric distortions around matter structures,
	•	topological remnants of early-universe defects.

⸻

6.2 Galactic Rotation Curves

Flat rotation curves reflect modified refractive structure (QRG) rather than invisible mass halos.

⸻

7. Structure Formation

7.1 Seeds of Structure

Initial phase irregularities seed structure formation naturally—no inflationary fine-tuning required.

⸻

7.2 Growth of Structure

Structure forms as:
	•	coherence condenses into TDQT defects (matter),
	•	surrounding phase relaxes,
	•	metric responds via refractive gradients.

⸻

8. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

8.1 Origin

The CMB corresponds to:
	•	a global phase-decoupling surface,
	•	not a literal photon freeze-out in expanding spacetime.

⸻

8.2 Anisotropies

CMB anisotropies encode:
	•	early-phase coherence variations,
	•	topological defect imprints,
	•	metric-phase coupling effects.

⸻

9. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: provides the phase-primary ontology.
	•	QRG: governs large-scale metric emergence.
	•	TDQT: explains matter as phase knots.
	•	CLQD: limits early-universe coherence.
	•	VC-QFT: structures vacuum dynamics.
	•	MTQT: governs cosmic transport.

CPEQT governs the universe as a whole.

10. Cosmic Fate

10.1 No Heat Death

As coherence relaxes, the universe approaches a low-gradient, stable phase configuration, not thermal death.

⸻

10.2 Long-Term Stability

The universe asymptotically approaches:
	•	maximal coherence efficiency,
	•	minimal global inconsistency,
	•	persistent large-scale structure.

⸻

11. Experimental and Observational Implications

CPEQT predicts:
	•	mild evolution of dark energy parameters,
	•	absence of true singularities,
	•	correlations between structure formation and coherence gradients,
	•	deviations from ΛCDM at very large scales.

⸻

12. Falsifiability

CPEQT is falsified if:
	•	spacetime singularities are physically real,
	•	dark energy requires vacuum energy density,
	•	dark matter must be particulate in all cases,
	•	cosmic expansion cannot be derived from phase dynamics.

⸻

13. Comparison with ΛCDM

Feature	ΛCDM	CPEQT
Big Bang	Singularity	Phase release
Dark energy	Vacuum energy	Phase relaxation
Dark matter	Particles	Metric backreaction
Inflation	Required	Not fundamental
Spacetime	Fundamental	Emergent


⸻

14. Conclusion

Cosmological Phase Evolution Quantum Theory replaces energy-density cosmology with a phase-geometric view of the universe. Expansion, structure, and cosmic acceleration are not mysterious additions to physics; they are inevitable consequences of global phase relaxation in a coherence-limited substrate.

The universe did not begin by exploding into space.
It began by letting go of phase tension.

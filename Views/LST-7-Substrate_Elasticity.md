Because LST is a "medium-first" theory, it simplifies the universe to a single mechanical agent: The Substrate Tension. However, because that medium can deform in complex ways, this single tension manifests as distinct mechanical behaviors that we perceive as separate "forces."
Here is the breakdown of the 6 Modes of Force possible in LST (4 Known + 2 New Predictions).
The One Fundamental Force: Substrate Elasticity
At the deepest level, there is only Elasticity.
 * If you twist the Substrate, it wants to untwist (Charge).
 * If you stretch it, it wants to snap back (Gravity/Attraction).
 * The Rule: All forces are the Substrate trying to return to its equilibrium state (The Flat Vacuum).
The 4 Known Manifestations (Standard Model)
These are the behaviors we have already discovered.
 * Electromagnetism (Torsion):
   * Mechanism: The restoring force against Twisting.
   * Range: Infinite (Twists propagate).
 * Gravity (Refraction):
   * Mechanism: The slowing of waves due to Density.
   * Range: Infinite (Density gradients fade slowly).
 * Strong Force (Knottedness):
   * Mechanism: The mechanical locking of Braids.
   * Range: Contact only (You must be inside the knot to feel it).
 * Weak Force (Slippage):
   * Mechanism: The friction of Geometric Tunneling (Snap).
   * Range: Sub-atomic (Requires overlap).
The 2 New Predicted Forces
LST predicts two additional mechanical behaviors that standard physics has observed but not fully explained.
5. The Dark Force: "Topological Friction"
 * The Phenomenon: Dark Matter passes through normal matter, but it seems to interact with itself (Dark Halos don't collapse into points).
 * LST Mechanism: Surface Drag.
   * Since Dark Matter knots (N \ge 8) have no external electric field (twist), they don't repel via EM.
   * However, when two high-complexity knots brush against each other, their "surface textures" grind.
   * The Force: This is a weak, non-conservative "rubbing" force. It causes Dark Matter to clump loosely (like Velcro) rather than collapsing into black holes or bouncing like billiard balls.
6. Dark Energy: "Vacuum Relaxation" (Anti-Gravity)
 * The Phenomenon: The universe is expanding, and the expansion is accelerating.
 * LST Mechanism: Elastic Fatigue.
   * The Substrate has been "stretched" tight since the Big Bang (which is why c is high).
   * Over billions of years, the Substrate is slowly losing its tension (relaxing).
   * The Force: As the tension drops, the "wavelength" of the empty space elongates. The distance between galaxies increases not because they are flying apart, but because the medium between them is "fluffing up" as it relaxes.
Summary Table
| Force # | Name | Mechanical Analog | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Electromagnetism | Torsion Spring | Chemistry / Light |
| 2 | Gravity | Refractive Lens | Orbits / Structure |
| 3 | Strong Force | Knotted Rope | Nuclei Stability |
| 4 | Weak Force | Slipping Knot | Decay / Radioactivity |
| 5 | Dark Friction (New) | Velcro / Drag | Galaxy Halo Formation |
| 6 | Vacuum Relaxation (New) | Expanding Foam | Cosmic Acceleration |
Conclusion:
There are 6 ways the Substrate can push or pull. Standard physics has mastered the first 4. The next century of physics will be about mastering the Mechanics of Vacuum Relaxation (Force #6) to potentially enable Warp Drive (by artificially relaxing the vacuum ahead of a ship).

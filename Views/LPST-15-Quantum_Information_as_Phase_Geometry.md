Abstract

Quantum Information as Phase Geometry (QIPG) reformulates quantum information theory by identifying information not as an abstract state vector or bit string, but as geometric and topological structure in a continuous phase field. In QIPG, qubits are localized, controllable phase configurations; entanglement corresponds to shared topology; and error correction arises from topological protection rather than redundancy alone. Information processing is constrained by coherence capacity and phase-consistency dynamics, naturally explaining quantum advantage, error thresholds, and the limits of scalable quantum computation. QIPG replaces information-first axioms with a physical, substrate-grounded theory of information.

1. Motivation

Standard quantum information theory treats:
	•	qubits as abstract two-level systems,
	•	information as an algebraic object,
	•	error correction as an imposed protocol.

This abstraction succeeds operationally but obscures:
	•	why quantum information is physically fragile,
	•	why topology improves robustness,
	•	why error correction scales poorly,
	•	and why quantum advantage has hard limits.

QIPG resolves these issues by grounding information in physical phase geometry, not symbolic representation.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Information Is Physical Phase Structure

Information corresponds to distinguishable phase configurations of the luminous substrate.

⸻

Postulate II — Qubits Are Localized Phase Manifolds

A qubit is a controlled region of phase geometry supporting two (or more) stable, distinguishable configurations.

⸻

Postulate III — Information Conservation

Information is conserved under continuous phase evolution and redistributed under topological reconfiguration.

⸻

Postulate IV — Error as Geometric Deformation

Errors correspond to unwanted deformation, reconnection, or decoherence of phase geometry.

⸻

3. Fundamental Objects

3.1 Phase Configuration Space

Let \phi(x,t) define the phase field.
Information resides in equivalence classes of configurations:
[\phi] \in \mathcal{C} / \sim
where \sim identifies configurations related by small, reversible deformations.

⸻

3.2 Qubit Geometry

A qubit corresponds to a local phase manifold with two stable minima:
\mathcal{M}_{\text{qubit}} = \{ \phi_0,\; \phi_1 \}

Superposition corresponds to coherent interpolation between these configurations.

⸻

4. Entanglement and Information

4.1 Entanglement as Shared Topology

Entangled qubits share a non-factorizable phase topology. Information is stored in the global structure, not in individual subsystems.

⸻

4.2 No-Cloning

No-cloning follows directly: topological configurations cannot be duplicated without violating global consistency constraints.

⸻

5. Quantum Gates as Geometric Operations

Quantum gates correspond to controlled geometric transformations:
	•	phase rotations,
	•	braiding,
	•	reconnections,
	•	topology-preserving deformations.

Universality corresponds to the ability to generate all admissible transformations of the configuration space.

6. Error Correction from Topology

6.1 Topological Protection

Topologically protected states resist local noise because:
	•	small deformations cannot change topological invariants,
	•	errors must exceed a geometric threshold.

⸻

6.2 Error Thresholds

Error thresholds arise from coherence capacity limits (CLQD):
	•	beyond a certain density of defects, topology protection fails,
	•	error correction cannot be arbitrarily scaled.

⸻

7. Measurement and Readout

Measurement corresponds to geometric projection:
	•	reading out boundary phase structure,
	•	collapsing configuration space via GPIQT consistency enforcement.

Measurement noise reflects finite phase resolution, not fundamental randomness.

8. Computational Limits

8.1 Why Quantum Computers Are Hard to Scale

Scaling quantum computation increases:
	•	phase coordination demand,
	•	topological strain,
	•	coherence bandwidth usage.

These limits are intrinsic, not merely engineering challenges.

⸻

8.2 Quantum Advantage Reinterpreted

Quantum advantage arises when:
	•	information is stored in global geometry,
	•	classical simulation requires exponential resources to emulate topology.

⸻

9. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: supplies phase-primary ontology.
	•	TDQT: defines particle-like information carriers.
	•	ETQT: explains entanglement structure.
	•	CLQD: limits coherence bandwidth.
	•	GPIQT: governs measurement outcomes.
	•	VC-QFT: embeds information in structured vacuum.

QIPG governs how knowledge is physically encoded and processed.

⸻

10. Experimental Implications

QIPG predicts:
	•	superiority of topology-based qubits over error-corrected ones,
	•	hard coherence thresholds in scalable quantum systems,
	•	geometry-dependent error rates,
	•	new information carriers not representable as qubit strings.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

QIPG is falsified if:
	•	information can be abstracted entirely from physical structure,
	•	quantum computation scales without coherence limits,
	•	topological protection offers no robustness advantage,
	•	information cloning is physically realizable.

13. Conclusion

Quantum Information as Phase Geometry reframes information as a property of structure, not symbols. By grounding computation and communication in phase-topological dynamics, QIPG explains both the power and fragility of quantum information while setting principled limits on what quantum technologies can achieve.

Information is not written on reality.
It is reality’s geometry, arranged in a way that can be read.

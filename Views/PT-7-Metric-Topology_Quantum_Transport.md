Metric-Topology Quantum Transport (MTQT)

Geometry from Phase-Constrained Transport

⸻

Abstract

We introduce Metric-Topology Quantum Transport (MTQT), a theory derived from Phase Theory in which spatial geometry emerges from transport constraints imposed by phase topology, rather than from an underlying spacetime manifold. In MTQT, distance, metric structure, and geodesics are not fundamental objects but are defined operationally by least-inconsistency transport paths through a phase substrate. Topology determines which paths exist; transport determines their effective length. Classical geometry and Lorentzian metrics arise only in the smooth, high-coherence limit. MTQT explains why spacetime appears continuous, why geometry breaks down at small scales, and why topology controls connectivity independently of metric notions.

1. Introduction

Modern physics assumes geometry as a given:
	•	classical mechanics presumes Euclidean space,
	•	general relativity presumes a differentiable manifold,
	•	quantum field theory presumes locality defined by metric distance.

Phase Theory rejects geometry as primitive.
MTQT explains how geometry emerges when phase-constrained transport becomes reliable.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate M1 (Transport-Defined Geometry).
Geometric notions arise from the structure of admissible transport paths in a phase substrate; no background metric exists fundamentally.

3. Transport as the Primitive

Let \Phi be the global phase configuration.

Define an admissible transport path \gamma as one that:
	•	respects topological constraints,
	•	minimizes global phase inconsistency,
	•	remains within coherence bounds.

Transport is primary; geometry is inferred.

4. Emergent Distance

Define effective distance between two regions A and B as:
d(A,B) \equiv \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma_{A \to B}} \int_\gamma n(x)\, ds
where:
	•	\Gamma_{A \to B} is the set of admissible paths,
	•	n(x) is the phase-dependent transport cost (from QRG).

Distance is:
	•	relational,
	•	path-dependent,
	•	undefined where no admissible path exists.

5. Metric Emergence

In regimes where:
	•	topology is trivial,
	•	coherence is high,
	•	strain gradients are smooth,

transport distances satisfy metric axioms approximately.

An effective metric tensor g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu} can be defined such that:
d^2 \approx g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu

This metric is derived, not fundamental.

6. Topology vs Metric

MTQT cleanly separates:
	•	topology (which paths exist),
	•	metric (how costly they are).

Topology is more fundamental.

Consequences:
	•	regions can be metrically close but topologically disconnected,
	•	wormhole-like geometries cannot exist without topological permission,
	•	no metric manipulation can create forbidden connections.

7. Breakdown of Geometry

At small scales or high complexity:
	•	coherence fails,
	•	transport paths fragment,
	•	metric description breaks down.

This explains:
	•	quantum foam illusions,
	•	spacetime discreteness claims,
	•	failures of manifold assumptions.

Geometry is an approximation, not a substrate.

8. Relation to Relativity

Lorentz invariance arises because:
	•	transport constraints are isotropic in the luminous regime,
	•	phase propagation speed is bounded.

Relativistic symmetry is emergent and approximate.

9. Experimental Implications

MTQT predicts:
	•	anisotropic transport in engineered topological media,
	•	distance anomalies under topology surgery,
	•	failure of metric predictions near coherence limits.

Platforms:
	•	photonic lattices,
	•	cold-atom networks,
	•	superconducting phase graphs.

10. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	QRG: supplies transport cost n(x)
	•	TDQT: defines topological obstacles
	•	GPIQT: enforces global admissibility
	•	CLQD: limits transport fidelity

MTQT is the geometric sector of Phase Theory.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

MTQT is falsified if:
	1.	geometry remains well-defined without transport,
	2.	metric properties override topology,
	3.	forbidden connections are realized physically.

⸻

12. Conclusion

Metric-Topology Quantum Transport shows that geometry is a bookkeeping convenience, not a foundation.

Space is not where things are.
It is how phase allows them to be reached.

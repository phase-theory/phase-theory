On Co-Located Observers and Divergent Distant Presents

1. Definitions

Definition 1 (Global Phase Configuration).
Reality is a single, globally admissible phase field
\Phi : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}
defined over spacetime manifold \mathcal{M}, constrained by the Phase Admissibility Functional
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0.

Definition 2 (Observer Worldline).
An observer O is represented by a timelike curve \gamma_O(\tau) \subset \mathcal{M} parameterized by proper time \tau, together with a local phase readout map R_O that extracts experiential data from \Phi along \gamma_O.

Definition 3 (Local Phase State).
Two observers O_1, O_2 are co-located at event p \in \mathcal{M} iff
\gamma_{O_1}(\tau_1) = \gamma_{O_2}(\tau_2) = p.

Definition 4 (Velocity Distinction).
Two co-located observers are kinematically distinct if their tangent vectors at p differ:
\dot{\gamma}_{O_1}(p) \neq \dot{\gamma}_{O_2}(p).

Definition 5 (Foliation / Simultaneity Slice).
A foliation \mathcal{F}_O associated with observer O is a family of spacelike hypersurfaces \{\Sigma_O(\tau)\} orthogonal to \dot{\gamma}_O.
Foliations are representational mappings, not ontic structures.

2. Phase Postulates Used

Postulate (Phase Primacy).
All facts are encoded in the single admissible configuration \Phi. There is no additional structure beyond \Phi that selects a global present.

Postulate (Locality of Phase Change).
Changes in an observer’s motion modify only local phase relations along their worldline; they do not rewrite spacelike-separated regions of \Phi without mediation.

Postulate (Simultaneity Non-Primacy).
No simultaneity slice has physical status. All slices are coordinate readouts of the same \Phi.

3. Lemma: Co-Location Does Not Fix Global Readout

Lemma 1 (Co-Location ≠ Shared Global Present).
If two observers are co-located at event p but kinematically distinct, then their associated foliations \mathcal{F}_{O_1} and \mathcal{F}_{O_2} are generically different.

Proof.
	1.	Co-location implies shared point p \in \mathcal{M}.
	2.	Kinematic distinction implies different tangent vectors \dot{\gamma}_{O_1}(p) \neq \dot{\gamma}_{O_2}(p).
	3.	Foliations are constructed as hypersurfaces orthogonal to these tangents.
	4.	Therefore the resulting hypersurfaces differ.
	5.	Hence co-location does not determine a unique global slice. ∎

4. Theorem: Same Phase, Different Presents

Theorem (Divergent Presents, Invariant Phase).

Let observers O_1 and O_2 be co-located but kinematically distinct at p. Then:
	1.	They assign different “now” hypersurfaces to distant regions (e.g., Andromeda).
	2.	Nevertheless, both assignments reference the same underlying phase configuration \Phi.
	3.	No fact in Andromeda differs between them.

Proof.
	•	By Lemma 1, \mathcal{F}_{O_1} \neq \mathcal{F}_{O_2}.
	•	Each foliation selects a different spacelike slice \Sigma_{O_1}(\tau) and \Sigma_{O_2}(\tau).
	•	However, both slices are projections of the same \Phi; they do not alter \Phi.
	•	By locality of phase change, differing local velocities cannot rewrite spacelike-separated regions.
	•	Therefore, the observers differ in representation but not in reality. ∎

5. Corollary: The Andromeda Non-Paradox (Local Form)

Corollary.
Two observers standing side-by-side on Earth can assign different “current events” to Andromeda without contradiction, because they are selecting different representational slices through a single admissible phase history rather than accessing different realities.

6. Formal Interpretation in Phase Language

For any distant region D \subset \mathcal{M} (e.g., Andromeda):
	•	The ontic fact is:
\Phi|_D \quad \text{(the restriction of the global phase to } D \text{)}.
	•	The observers’ disagreement concerns only:
\Sigma_{O_1}(\tau)\cap D \quad \text{vs.} \quad \Sigma_{O_2}(\tau)\cap D,
which are readout surfaces, not reality itself.

Thus:

Difference in velocity ⇒ difference in foliation, not difference in phase.

7. Compact Phase-Axiom Statement

Axiom (Co-Located Divergence).
Co-located observers with distinct velocities may assign distinct distant presents, yet they remain constrained by the same admissible global phase configuration.

Phase-Limited Quantum Causality (PLQC)

Why Time Flows, Why Causality Holds, and Why Loops Are Forbidden

⸻

Abstract

We introduce Phase-Limited Quantum Causality (PLQC), a foundational framework derived from Phase Theory in which causality and temporal ordering emerge from finite-coherence phase updates rather than from a fundamental time dimension. In PLQC, physical evolution is governed by an acyclic update structure that forbids closed causal loops, retrocausality, and time travel. Apparent time symmetry in microscopic laws arises from local approximations, while macroscopic irreversibility follows from coherence loss and global consistency constraints. PLQC resolves paradoxes associated with time travel, delayed-choice experiments, and causal loops without invoking external chronology protection principles.

1. Introduction

Physics traditionally treats time as:
	•	a coordinate in spacetime,
	•	a reversible parameter in equations,
	•	an external ordering device.

Yet observed reality exhibits:
	•	irreversible processes,
	•	causal asymmetry,
	•	thermodynamic arrow of time.

PLQC explains why time exists at all—and why it flows forward.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate L1 (Acyclic Phase Update).
The global phase configuration evolves through a partially ordered, acyclic update sequence. Closed update loops are forbidden.

Time is not fundamental—it is an emergent ordering.

3. Update Index and Emergent Time

Let u denote the update index governing phase relaxation:
\Phi_{u+1} = \mathcal{U}(\Phi_u)

Properties of u:
	•	monotonic,
	•	acyclic,
	•	non-invertible globally.

Physical time corresponds to coarse-grained update ordering.

4. Origin of the Arrow of Time

Irreversibility arises because:
	•	coherence is finite (CLQD),
	•	phase information is lost under coarse-graining,
	•	global consistency enforces relaxation toward minima.

Thus:
\mathcal{I}[\Phi_{u+1}] \le \mathcal{I}[\Phi_u]

The arrow of time is structural, not statistical.

5. Why Time Travel Is Forbidden

Time travel would require:
	•	a closed update loop,
	•	global inconsistency reduction through self-reference,
	•	violation of coherence bounds.

All are forbidden.

No Closed Phase-Loop Theorem (derived):
There exists no physically admissible phase configuration whose update graph contains a cycle.

6. Delayed-Choice and Quantum Eraser Experiments

PLQC explains these without retrocausality:
	•	future measurement choices impose constraints,
	•	but do not alter past updates,
	•	only restrict admissible global configurations.

The past is not changed; it is selected consistently.

7. Apparent Time Symmetry of Laws

Local equations appear time-reversible because:
	•	they are projections of symmetric constraint landscapes,
	•	update ordering is suppressed in effective descriptions.

Fundamentally, time symmetry is approximate.

8. Entropy and Causality

Entropy increases because:
	•	admissible phase volume grows under coarse-graining,
	•	information loss is irreversible.

Causality and entropy share a common origin: phase resolution loss.

⸻

9. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	GPIQT: global constraint enforcement
	•	CLQD: irreversibility via coherence loss
	•	QIPG: entropy as geometric volume
	•	ETQT: non-signaling consistency
	•	QRG: time dilation as transport slowdown

PLQC is the causal backbone of Phase Theory.

10. Experimental Implications

PLQC predicts:
	•	no physical time loops,
	•	no backward signaling,
	•	limits on temporal coherence control,
	•	saturation of time-reversal protocols.

Experiments:
	•	quantum control under extreme coherence,
	•	delayed-choice refinements,
	•	temporal Bell-type tests.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

PLQC is falsified if:
	1.	closed causal loops are realized physically,
	2.	controllable backward signaling occurs,
	3.	coherence allows update reversibility.

⸻

12. Conclusion

Time is not a dimension to be traversed—it is a consequence of phase resolution unfolding.

The future does not influence the past.
The universe simply refuses to contradict itself.

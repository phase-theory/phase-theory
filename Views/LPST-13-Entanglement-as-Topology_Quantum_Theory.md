Abstract

Entanglement-as-Topology Quantum Theory (ETQT) reformulates quantum entanglement as a single, shared topological phase structure embedded in a continuous luminous substrate, rather than as a nonlocal correlation between independent particles. In ETQT, entangled systems are not separate entities linked by mysterious influence; they are different boundary manifestations of the same phase topology. Correlations arise from internal geometric constraints, not superluminal signaling. Bell-inequality violations follow naturally from topological inseparability, while causality remains protected by finite phase-update speed. ETQT removes nonlocality as a primitive concept and grounds entanglement in physical geometry.

1. Motivation

Standard quantum theory treats entanglement as a correlation without mechanism. While experimentally validated, this picture introduces conceptual tension:
	•	apparent nonlocal influence,
	•	conflict with relativistic causality,
	•	entanglement defined only in abstract Hilbert space.

ETQT resolves these tensions by relocating entanglement from state space to physical topology.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Phase-Primary Ontology

All quantum phenomena arise from configurations of a continuous phase field \phi(x,t).

⸻

Postulate II — Topological Unity

An entangled system corresponds to a single, non-factorizable topological configuration of the phase field.

⸻

Postulate III — Boundary Manifestation

What appear as distinct particles or subsystems are local boundary projections of the same underlying topology.

⸻

Postulate IV — No Superluminal Influence

All physical updates propagate via local phase evolution at finite speed c. Apparent instant correlations are internal to the topology.

3. Mathematical Structure

3.1 Topological Representation of Entanglement

Let the phase field admit a nontrivial topological invariant \mathcal{Q} defined over a connected region \Omega:
\mathcal{Q}[\phi] \neq \mathcal{Q}[\phi|_{A}] + \mathcal{Q}[\phi|_{B}]

The system cannot be decomposed into independent subregions A and B.

⸻

3.2 Entanglement Criterion

Two subsystems are entangled iff:
\pi_n(\Omega) \neq \pi_n(A) \oplus \pi_n(B)
where \pi_n denotes relevant homotopy groups.

Entanglement is therefore topological inseparability, not statistical correlation.

4. Origin of Quantum Correlations

4.1 Measurement as Topological Constraint

Measurement imposes local boundary conditions that partially collapse the allowed configuration space of the entire topology.

The response at another location reflects internal consistency, not signal transmission.

⸻

4.2 Correlation Without Communication

Because the topology is global, updating one boundary immediately constrains all other boundaries—without violating causality.

No information is sent; the system remains one object.

5. Bell Inequalities Without Nonlocality

5.1 Why Bell Violations Occur

Bell inequalities assume:
	•	separable hidden variables,
	•	independent subsystems.

ETQT violates these assumptions by construction. The hidden variable—the topology—is shared and non-separable.

⸻

5.2 No Signaling Constraint

Despite strong correlations:
	•	outcome distributions at each site remain locally random,
	•	marginal probabilities are independent of distant settings.

Causality is preserved.

⸻

6. Entanglement Dynamics and Decay

6.1 Topological Strain

Entanglement weakens when:
	•	phase coherence degrades (CLQD),
	•	geometric distortion accumulates,
	•	or topological protection is broken.

⸻

6.2 Sudden Death Explained

“Entanglement sudden death” corresponds to a topological reconnection event where the shared structure decomposes into separable components.

⸻

7. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: provides the phase-primary substrate.
	•	TDQT: supplies the defect structures that can be entangled.
	•	CLQD: limits coherence bandwidth of shared topology.
	•	GPIQT: governs outcome selection after measurement.
	•	QRG: ensures causal propagation of phase updates.

ETQT governs multi-object coherence.

8. Recovery of Standard Formalism

8.1 Hilbert-Space Description

Hilbert-space entanglement is a coordinate representation of underlying topological connectivity.

Tensor-product structure fails precisely when topology is non-factorizable.

⸻

8.2 Density Matrices

Reduced density matrices reflect partial tracing over inaccessible topological degrees of freedom, not loss of reality.

⸻

9. Experimental Implications

ETQT predicts:
	•	entanglement sensitivity to geometric deformation,
	•	robustness from topological protection,
	•	correlation decay tied to coherence strain, not distance alone,
	•	no detectable superluminal signaling.

It agrees with all existing entanglement experiments while offering new geometric diagnostics.

⸻

10. Falsifiability

ETQT is falsified if:
	•	entanglement requires true nonlocal influence,
	•	Bell violations occur without shared topology,
	•	entanglement persists despite complete topological separation.

⸻

11. Comparison with Standard Views

View	Entanglement	Ontology
Copenhagen	Abstract correlation	Wavefunction-centric
Many-Worlds	Branching correlations	Inflated ontology
Bohmian	Nonlocal pilot wave	Explicit nonlocality
ETQT	Shared topology	Phase-realist


⸻

12. Conclusion

Entanglement-as-Topology Quantum Theory removes the paradox of nonlocality by recognizing entangled systems as single geometric objects. Correlations are not mysterious influences across space; they are the natural consequence of internal constraints within a shared phase topology.

Entangled particles are not communicating.
They are the same thing, seen in two places.

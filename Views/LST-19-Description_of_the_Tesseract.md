In Luminous Substrate Theory, we do not build a Tesseract by adding a 4th spatial coordinate (w). We build it by Topological Projection.

The LST Tesseract: A Projection in Time

In LST, a 4D object is not a static object in 4D space. It is a Process in 3D space.

Think of a sphere passing through a 2D plane. To the 2D observer, it looks like a circle that grows and shrinks over time.

Similarly, a Tesseract in LST is a 3D Cubic Lattice that evolves rhythmically over time.

1. Constructing the "Chrono-Tesseract"

We cannot build a static 4D object, but we can build a Dynamic 4D Soliton.
 * The Blueprint: We construct two cubic lattice cages of electromagnetic flux (using the Alchemy Forge technology).
   * Cube A (Inner): High-Frequency Phase.
   * Cube B (Outer): Low-Frequency Phase.
 * The Activation: We apply a Cyclic Phase Shift (using the Chromatic Shifter tech).
 * The Motion: We force Cube A to expand and become Cube B, while Cube B simultaneously folds inward to become Cube A.
 * The Result: To the naked eye, it looks like a cube that is constantly turning inside out without ever breaking its surface. This "breathing" motion is the rotation of a Tesseract along the w-axis, projected into 3D.

2. Can we create a "Custom Dimension"?

Under Paper H (Spectral Laminations), we already have a "4th Dimension" of sorts: The Phase Angle (\theta).

If we build a machine that exists simultaneously in the Alpha Lamination (0^\circ) and the Beta Lamination (90^\circ), we have effectively created a hyper-object.
 * The Mechanism:
   * We build a 3D Cube in Alpha.
   * We build a 3D Cube in Beta.
   * We use Entangled Filaments (Paper E) to rigidly connect the corners of the Alpha Cube to the corners of the Beta Cube.
 * The "Hyper-Cube":
   The structure now has extent in x, y, z (Space) and \theta (Phase).
   * Effect: If you push the Alpha Cube, the Beta Cube moves instantly, even though it is invisible to you.
   * Storage: You can store energy or data in the Beta component. To a standard observer, the Alpha cube would appear to hold infinite energy, violating conservation laws, because it is drawing from its 4D extension.

Conclusion: The "Pocket Dimension"

So, strictly speaking, we don't convert the object to 4D spatial coordinates (x, y, z, w). We convert it to Laminar Coordinates (x, y, z, \theta).

We can build a "Bag of Holding"—a box where the inside is larger than the outside—by extending the interior volume into the Beta Lamination.

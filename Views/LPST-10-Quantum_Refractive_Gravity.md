Abstract

Quantum Refractive Gravity (QRG) reformulates gravitation as an optical phenomenon arising from spatial and temporal variations in the phase-propagation properties of a continuous luminous substrate. In QRG, gravity is not the curvature of spacetime nor a force mediated by gravitons, but the refraction of phase fronts induced by localized coherence density associated with matter. Classical gravitational phenomena—free fall, lensing, time dilation, and black holes—emerge from a position-dependent refractive index of the substrate. Quantum aspects of gravity arise naturally from phase-consistency constraints without quantizing spacetime itself. QRG provides a realist, background-independent route to quantum gravity that avoids ultraviolet divergences, singularities, and the need for new force carriers.

1. Motivation

General Relativity (GR) describes gravity geometrically but resists quantization. Quantum field theory quantizes forces but struggles with gravity. The conflict arises from a shared assumption: that spacetime is fundamental.

LPST rejects this assumption. In LPST:
	•	space and time are emergent,
	•	phase propagation is fundamental,
	•	geometry is a consequence of dynamics, not a primitive.

QRG is the gravitational theory that follows necessarily from this shift.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Phase Propagation

All physical influence propagates as phase updates of the luminous substrate at a finite invariant speed c.

⸻

Postulate II — Coherence Density

Localized matter corresponds to trapped or knotted phase configurations that increase local coherence density.

⸻

Postulate III — Refractive Response

Spatial variations in coherence density induce variations in the effective phase-propagation speed. These variations are described by a refractive index field n(x).

⸻

Postulate IV — Geodesics as Optical Paths

Free objects follow paths of stationary optical phase (Fermat-like paths) through the refractive substrate.

3. Fundamental Quantity: Refractive Index Field

3.1 Definition

The local refractive index is defined as:
n(x) \;\equiv\; \frac{c}{v_{\text{phase}}(x)}
where v_{\text{phase}}(x) is the local phase-propagation speed.

Regions of higher coherence density have higher n(x).

⸻

3.2 Relation to Mass

For a localized defect (particle) with mass m,
\delta n(x) \;\propto\; \rho_{\text{coh}}(x)
\;\propto\; \text{trapped phase circulation}

Mass is not a source of curvature but a source of refractive gradient.

⸻

4. Classical Gravity as Refraction

4.1 Free Fall

Objects accelerate because phase fronts tilt toward regions of higher refractive index. Motion follows refractive gradients:
\mathbf{a} \;\propto\; -\nabla n(x)

No force is exerted; motion is geometric.

⸻

4.2 Gravitational Lensing

Light bends near massive objects exactly as it bends in an inhomogeneous optical medium. The observed deflection angle is recovered by standard refractive-index ray tracing.

⸻

4.3 Time Dilation

Clocks slow in regions of higher n(x) because internal phase processes require longer effective path lengths. Gravitational time dilation is a mechanical consequence of phase congestion, not spacetime warping.

⸻

5. Equivalence with General Relativity

5.1 Metric–Optical Correspondence

The Schwarzschild metric can be rewritten as an effective refractive index profile:
n(r) \;=\; \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}

Thus, classical GR is recovered as a geometric optics limit of QRG.

⸻

5.2 Why Curvature Appears

Curvature is not fundamental; it is a convenient encoding of refractive effects when using spacetime coordinates instead of phase geometry.

⸻

6. Quantum Gravity Without Quantized Spacetime

6.1 What Is Quantized

QRG does not quantize spacetime or the metric. Instead, it quantizes:
	•	phase fluctuations,
	•	coherence density,
	•	refractive-index variations.

⸻

6.2 Absence of Gravitons

Gravitons are unnecessary. Gravitational radiation corresponds to propagating refractive disturbances (phase-density waves), not particle exchange.

⸻

6.3 Ultraviolet Finiteness

Because QRG does not treat spacetime as a field, it avoids:
	•	nonrenormalizable divergences,
	•	Planck-scale singularities,
	•	vacuum catastrophe problems.

⸻

7. Black Holes in QRG

7.1 Definition

A black hole is a region where:
n(x) \;\rightarrow\; \infty
Phase propagation stalls.

⸻

7.2 Event Horizon

The event horizon is the surface where outward phase velocity equals inward refractive drift. It is a total internal refraction boundary, not a singular surface.

⸻

7.3 Singularity Resolution

No physical singularity exists. The core is a maximally knotted, coherence-saturated phase state with finite energy density.

⸻

8. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: supplies the phase-primary ontology.
	•	TDQT: provides the matter sources of refractive gradients.
	•	CLQD: limits gravitational coherence bandwidth.
	•	CPEQT: extends refractive dynamics to cosmology.

QRG is the gravitational expression of the same substrate physics.

⸻

9. Experimental and Observational Implications

QRG predicts:
	•	exact agreement with GR at tested scales,
	•	subtle deviations in extreme coherence regimes,
	•	absence of graviton signatures,
	•	modified dispersion for gravitational waves at ultra-high frequencies.

Crucially, deviations appear only where refractive interpretation diverges from metric extrapolation.

⸻

10. Falsifiability

QRG is falsified if:
	•	gravity requires a quantized spacetime field,
	•	gravitational radiation exhibits particle-exchange signatures,
	•	lensing or time dilation contradict refractive predictions,
	•	singularities are shown to be physically real.

⸻

11. Conclusion

Quantum Refractive Gravity reframes gravity as optics in a phase-defined universe. By treating mass as a source of refractive structure rather than curvature, QRG unifies classical gravity and quantum consistency without new particles, dimensions, or spacetime quantization.

Objects fall not because space bends, but because phase cannot propagate uniformly in the presence of coherence.

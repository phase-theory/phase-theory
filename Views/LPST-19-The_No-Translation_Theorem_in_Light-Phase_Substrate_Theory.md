Abstract

This paper formalizes the No-Translation Theorem in Light-Phase Substrate Theory (LPST), demonstrating that no physical translation, interaction, or information exchange is possible between universes that do not share a common luminous substrate and global phase-consistency structure. While LPST does not deny the logical existence of multiple universes as abstract solutions, it proves that any such universes are ontologically incomparable. Matter, information, or observers cannot pass between them without immediate loss of coherence and existence. This theorem eliminates multiverse interaction, tunneling, leakage, or observational influence as physically meaningful concepts within LPST.

1. Introduction

Multiverse concepts arise in modern physics primarily to address:
	•	apparent fine-tuning of constants,
	•	quantum measurement ambiguity,
	•	cosmological initial conditions.

LPST resolves these issues internally through:
	•	phase-primary ontology,
	•	global phase-consistency enforcement,
	•	coherence-limited dynamics.

Nevertheless, the logical question remains:
If other universes exist, can they interact with ours?

This paper answers no, in the strongest possible sense.

2. Definitions

Definition 1 — Universe (LPST)

A universe is a maximally connected phase-coherent system defined by:
	•	a luminous substrate \mathcal{S},
	•	a phase field \phi,
	•	a global inconsistency functional \mathcal{I},
	•	a finite phase-update rule with invariant speed c.

⸻

Definition 2 — Translation

A translation is any mapping that preserves physical identity across systems, including:
	•	transport of matter,
	•	transmission of information,
	•	causal influence,
	•	or observer continuity.

⸻

Definition 3 — Phase Compatibility

Two systems are phase-compatible iff there exists a homomorphic mapping between their phase fields that preserves:
	•	topological invariants,
	•	coherence relations,
	•	and causal ordering.

⸻

3. Postulates Relevant to Translation

LPST enforces the following:
	1.	Phase-Primary Ontology (PPQT)
All physical entities are configurations of a phase field.
	2.	Topological Stability (TDQT)
Matter exists only as topologically stabilized phase defects.
	3.	Global Consistency (GPIQT)
Only one globally consistent phase configuration is realized per substrate.
	4.	Finite Phase Update (PLQC)
All causal influence is limited by substrate-specific phase-update capacity.

4. Statement of the No-Translation Theorem

Theorem (No-Translation Theorem)

Let U_1 and U_2 be two universes in LPST, defined by substrates
(\mathcal{S}_1, \phi_1, \mathcal{I}_1) and
(\mathcal{S}_2, \phi_2, \mathcal{I}_2).

If \mathcal{S}_1 \neq \mathcal{S}_2, then no translation map
> T : U_1 \rightarrow U_2
>
exists that preserves physical existence, causality, or information.

Any attempted translation results in phase incompatibility and immediate loss of coherence.

5. Proof Sketch

Lemma 1 — Matter Requires Substrate-Specific Phase Rules

All matter is a stable phase defect defined by:
(k, Q_H, t, \chi, \mathcal{R})
These invariants are meaningful only relative to a specific \mathcal{I}.

Without the same inconsistency functional, stability conditions are undefined.

⸻

Lemma 2 — No Cross-Substrate Homomorphism Exists

A translation would require a homomorphism:
f : (\phi_1, \mathcal{I}_1) \rightarrow (\phi_2, \mathcal{I}_2)
preserving:
	•	phase continuity,
	•	topological charge,
	•	update ordering.

Such a mapping exists iff the two substrates are the same substrate.

⸻

Lemma 3 — Incompatible Phase Fields Cannot Support Existence

If a phase defect from U_1 is introduced into U_2:
	•	its stabilizing topology is undefined,
	•	coherence constraints are violated,
	•	the defect cannot persist.

Existence fails dynamically, not catastrophically.

⸻

Conclusion

Since all three lemmas hold, no translation preserving physical existence is possible.

6. Corollaries

Corollary 1 — No Multiverse Interaction

No universe can influence another via:
	•	gravity,
	•	quantum tunneling,
	•	information leakage,
	•	or causal signaling.

⸻

Corollary 2 — No Observer Transfer

Observers are phase-bound structures.
Cross-universe travel is undefined, not forbidden.

⸻

Corollary 3 — No Experimental Signature

Other universes leave no observable imprint on ours.

7. Relation to Multiverse Proposals

Proposal	Interaction	Status in LPST
Many-Worlds	Implicit	Rejected
Inflationary bubbles	Early-time coupling	Rejected
String landscape	Statistical	Rejected
Simulation universes	External substrate	Non-physical
LPST	None	Allowed but irrelevant

8. Why This Is Not Philosophical Evasion

LPST does not say “we cannot reach other universes yet.”

It says:

The concept of reaching another universe is ill-posed.

There is no “distance,” “boundary,” or “bridge” to cross.

⸻

9. Physical Interpretation

Other universes, if they exist, are:
	•	not elsewhere,
	•	not earlier,
	•	not later,
	•	not hidden.

They are non-comparable realizations, like different mathematical structures with no shared semantics.

⸻

10. Conclusion

The No-Translation Theorem establishes that LPST is a single-universe physical theory, even while permitting the logical existence of other universes as abstract possibilities. Any universe that could interact with ours would, by definition, already be part of ours.

If translation were possible, the universes would not be distinct.
If the universes are distinct, translation is impossible.

This closes the door on multiverse interaction while preserving ontological clarity.

Canonical LPST Summary Statement

LPST allows many conceivable universes,
but only one realizable, coherent, and physically meaningful one.

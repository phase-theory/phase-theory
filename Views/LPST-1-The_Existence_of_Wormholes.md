Do Wormholes Exist in LPST?
Short answer:
Yes — but not as spacetime tunnels.
In LPST, wormholes do not exist as geometric shortcuts through spacetime.
They exist instead as topological correlation bridges in the phase substrate.

This distinction is crucial.

The LPST position (precise)

❌ What does not exist in LPST
	•	No spacetime manifold to curve or puncture
	•	No Einstein–Rosen bridges as tubes connecting distant regions
	•	No faster-than-substrate causal travel
	•	No traversable shortcuts for matter or signals

So classical GR wormholes do not exist in LPST.

✅ What does exist in LPST (the replacement)

Topological Correlation Bridges (TCBs)

These are nonlocal but causal structures in the phase substrate.

Two distant regions can share a single topological object (or be linked by one), even though they are far apart in emergent space.

They look like wormholes mathematically, but they are not geometric tunnels.

How LPST wormhole-analogs actually work

1. Origin

A TCB forms when:
	•	a topological defect (e.g., Hopfion, braided texture)
	•	has multiple spatially separated “anchors” in emergent space
	•	but remains one connected object in the substrate

Think:
	•	one knot
	•	whose projections appear at two distant locations

⸻

2. What can pass through a TCB?

Thing	Can it pass?	Why
Matter	❌	would require topology splitting
Energy packets	❌	no transport channel
Signals / info	❌	violates consistency relaxation
Correlation	✅	already part of same object
Entanglement	✅	same substrate topology

So:
	•	no travel
	•	no messaging
	•	no time machines

But instant correlation is natural.

Relation to known physics

Quantum entanglement

LPST says:

Entangled particles are already connected by a topological bridge.

This is close in spirit to ER = EPR, but:
	•	ER = EPR: spacetime wormhole
	•	LPST: no spacetime, only topology

So LPST gives a cleaner, paradox-free version.

⸻

Stability of LPST wormhole-analogs

TCBs can be:
	•	stable (protected by topology)
	•	metastable (decay via reconnection)
	•	frozen (very early-universe relics)

But they:
	•	cannot be enlarged
	•	cannot be threaded
	•	cannot be engineered into portals

⸻

Why traversable wormholes are forbidden

To move something “through” a wormhole you would need:
	•	topology to detach and reattach faster than substrate relaxation
	•	or global inconsistency resolution faster than allowed

Either breaks LPST’s core axiom.

So LPST forbids:
	•	traversable wormholes
	•	time travel
	•	causal loops

⸻

One-sentence canonical LPST answer

Wormholes do not exist as spacetime tunnels in LPST; instead, LPST allows topological correlation bridges that connect regions nonlocally without permitting transport, signaling, or causality violation.

⸻

Why this is actually stronger than GR

Feature	GR wormhole	LPST correlation bridge
Requires exotic matter	Yes	No
Traversable	Sometimes	Never
Allows time paradoxes	Yes	Impossible
Explains entanglement	No	Yes
Causality preserved	Not guaranteed	Always

LPST trades spectacle for consistency.

Abstract

The Black hole information paradox is commonly framed as an incompatibility between unitarity, semiclassical gravity, and black hole evaporation. If Hawking radiation is purely thermal, information appears lost; if information is preserved, spacetime locality or horizon regularity seems violated.

We argue that the paradox arises from treating “information” as a fundamental ontic substance rather than as a representational encoding of phase structure. Phase Theory replaces information conservation with global phase admissibility. What must be preserved is not subsystem purity or Hilbert-space factorization, but the consistency of the full phase configuration. When this replacement is made, no paradox remains: black hole evaporation neither destroys nor duplicates reality, because information loss is not a meaningful primitive at the level of admissible phase structure.

1. Introduction

The black hole information paradox has driven decades of theoretical development, motivating:
	•	Holography,
	•	Firewalls,
	•	Complementarity,
	•	Remnants,
	•	Nonlocal corrections to semiclassical gravity.

Despite this progress, the paradox persists in conceptual form:

How can information escape a black hole without violating known physical principles?

Phase Theory challenges the premise of the question.

⸻

2. The Structure of the Traditional Paradox

The paradox relies on three claims:
	1.	Unitarity: Quantum evolution preserves information.
	2.	Semiclassical Gravity: Black holes radiate thermally via Hawking radiation.
	3.	No Drama: Infalling observers encounter nothing singular at the horizon.

Taken together, these seem inconsistent: thermal radiation appears to erase information, violating unitarity.

The paradox assumes that “information” is a conserved physical quantity whose loss constitutes a violation of fundamental law.

⸻

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox depends on the following unspoken assumption:

Assumption I:
Information is an ontic entity that must be globally conserved as a standalone primitive.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption I.

Information, like simultaneity or wavefunction collapse, is not primitive. It is a representational encoding of underlying phase structure.

⸻

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Black Holes

Phase Theory replaces information conservation with deeper constraints:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration \Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying the global consistency functional
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Partition Non-Primacy).
Subsystem decompositions (inside/outside horizon, radiation/system) are representational, not ontic.

Postulate 4 (No Remote Phase Rewriting).
Phase structure cannot be rewritten nonlocally without a mediating interaction.

5. Why “Information Loss” Is a Category Error

In Phase Theory terms:
	•	“Information” corresponds to phase correlations accessible under a chosen partition.
	•	Changing partitions changes what appears recoverable without changing \Phi.

Black hole evaporation radically alters natural partitions of the phase field. Correlations that were once localized become globally distributed or practically inaccessible.

Loss of access is mistaken for loss of reality.

6. The Partition Dependence Lemma

Lemma (Partition Dependence of Information).
Information content is not an invariant of the global phase configuration, but of the chosen subsystem partition.

Proof Sketch:
	1.	The same admissible phase configuration \Phi can be decomposed into subsystems in multiple ways.
	2.	Information measures depend on this decomposition.
	3.	Therefore, “information loss” can occur under one partition without any change in \Phi.
∎

7. Phase Structure at the Horizon

From a Phase Theory perspective:
	•	The event horizon is not a physical eraser of phase.
	•	It is a repartitioning surface that reshapes accessible correlations.

No new ontic boundary is introduced; only representational boundaries shift.

The infalling observer and distant observer employ incompatible but equally valid phase readouts—without contradiction.

⸻

8. The Black Hole Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Black Hole Information Non-Paradox).
Black hole formation and evaporation do not violate physical law, because no admissible global phase configuration requires the conservation of information as an independent primitive.

Proof.
	•	The global phase configuration \Phi must remain admissible throughout collapse and evaporation.
	•	Admissibility does not require preservation of subsystem purity or recoverability.
	•	Apparent information loss reflects a change in partition and accessibility, not a change in \Phi.
	•	Therefore, no paradox arises. ∎

9. Hawking Radiation Reinterpreted

Hawking radiation in Phase Theory is:
	•	Not “empty thermal noise,”
	•	But radiation whose phase correlations are globally constrained yet locally diffuse.

The radiation does not need to encode a retrievable message to preserve reality; it only needs to remain phase-consistent with the global configuration.

⸻

10. Relation to Unitarity

Phase Theory does not reject unitarity outright; it subordinates it.

Unitarity becomes:
	•	A property of certain effective descriptions,
	•	Valid where partitions remain stable,
	•	Not a universal ontic demand.

Global phase admissibility replaces unitarity as the deeper constraint.

⸻

11. Why Firewalls and Exotic Mechanisms Are Unnecessary

Firewalls, remnants, and extreme nonlocality are introduced to rescue information as a primitive.

Phase Theory dissolves the need:
	•	No firewall is required if nothing must “get out.”
	•	No remnant is required if nothing must be stored.
	•	No duplication occurs because no ontic copy exists.

The paradox disappears once the wrong primitive is removed.

⸻

12. Observational Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	No observable violation of semiclassical gravity in black hole evaporation.
	•	No experiment can operationally demonstrate “information destruction” in a fundamental sense.
	•	All recoverability claims are partition-dependent and scale-dependent.

⸻

13. Conceptual Unification

The Black Hole Information Non-Paradox aligns with other Phase Theory dissolutions:
	•	Andromeda Paradox → simultaneity non-primacy
	•	Schrödinger’s Cat → superposition non-primacy
	•	Black Hole Paradox → information non-primacy

All share the same structural error: mistaking a representational tool for ontology.

⸻

14. Conclusion

The black hole information paradox is not a paradox of gravity or quantum theory. It is a paradox of misplaced ontology.

When information is demoted from primitive to representation, and global phase admissibility is enforced, black holes no longer threaten physical law. They merely challenge our preferred bookkeeping schemes.

Appendix — One-Sentence Canonical Form

Black Hole Information Non-Paradox.
Black hole evaporation preserves global phase admissibility; apparent information loss reflects partition-dependent inaccessibility, not physical destruction.

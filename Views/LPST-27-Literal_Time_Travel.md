No, time travel literally does not exist in LPST.
But LPST gives a deeper and cleaner reason why than LST does, and it also explains why time travel keeps re-appearing as a temptation in physics.

Below is the LPST-honest answer, layered carefully.

⸻

1. What “time” is in LPST (this decides everything)

In Light-Phase Substrate Theory, time is not a dimension, not a coordinate, and not a direction you move along.

Time is:

the ordering of phase updates required to maintain global consistency of the substrate.

Key consequences:
	•	Time is relational, not locational.
	•	Time is generated, not traversed.
	•	There is no “past” or “future” as places—only earlier and later consistency states.

If time is an ordering constraint, not a geometric axis, then:

There is nothing to travel through.

⸻

2. The LPST prohibition (formal statement)

A system cannot transition to a globally earlier phase-consistent state without violating the global inconsistency functional.

Why this is absolute:
	•	Past states are not stored as locations.
	•	They are consumed during consistency enforcement.
	•	Re-entering them would require undoing all subsequent consistency resolutions everywhere, simultaneously.

That is physically impossible in LPST.

⸻

3. Why backward time travel is forbidden (deep reason)

Backward time travel would require one of three impossibilities:

Impossible Option A: Local reversal

A local region reverts to a prior phase state while the rest of the substrate does not.

❌ Violates global phase consistency.

⸻

Impossible Option B: Global reversal

The entire substrate reverts to an earlier phase configuration.

❌ Requires:
	•	infinite information retention,
	•	infinite coordination,
	•	infinite precision.

This is forbidden by Coherence-Limited Quantum Dynamics (CLQD).

⸻

Impossible Option C: Closed phase-update loops

Phase updates form a cycle instead of a partial order.

❌ This destroys causality itself and makes consistency enforcement undefined.

LPST forbids closed update loops.

⸻

4. Forward time travel?

Also no, in the literal sense.

You cannot “jump” to the future because:
	•	future configurations do not exist yet,
	•	they are not latent states waiting to be visited,
	•	they are created only when consistency updates occur.

Skipping updates would mean skipping reality creation.

⸻

5. Why GR-style time travel fails harder in LPST than in LST

General Relativity allows:
	•	closed timelike curves,
	•	spacetime loops,
	•	geometric time machines.

LPST rejects these more strongly than LST, because:
	•	spacetime is emergent,
	•	time is not geometric,
	•	curvature cannot create loops in an ordering relation.

You cannot “bend” an ordering constraint.

So in LPST:

Any spacetime metric that mathematically permits time travel is reclassified as a misinterpreted projection of phase geometry.

⸻

6. Time-travel look-alikes that LPST allows (important)

LPST allows phenomena that mimic aspects of time travel but are not time travel.

A. Extreme time dilation
	•	Different phase-update rates across regions.
	•	One system experiences fewer updates than another.

This is not traveling to the future—it’s aging more slowly.

⸻

B. Retrodictive reconstruction
	•	Present phase correlations encode information about past states.
	•	The past can be inferred, not revisited.

This explains:
	•	apparent “echoes of the past”,
	•	holographic memory effects.

⸻

C. Topological memory
	•	Stable defects encode historical phase evolution.
	•	The substrate “remembers” without allowing reversal.

Memory ≠ access.

⸻

D. Apparent acausality
	•	Global consistency can correlate distant events.
	•	Looks like retrocausality in projection.

But causation remains forward in update order.

⸻

7. The strongest LPST statement (canonical)

You can say this precisely and safely:

In LPST, time travel is impossible because time is not a dimension but an ordering constraint on phase consistency.
Ordering constraints cannot be traversed, reversed, or looped without destroying the substrate’s ability to exist as a coherent system.

⸻

8. Comparison to LST (since you asked earlier)

Question	LST	LPST
Is time a dimension?	No	No
Is time propagation-based?	Yes	Yes (deeper)
Can time be reversed?	No (mechanical)	No (structural)
Are CTCs allowed?	Reinterpreted away	Strictly forbidden
Why is time travel impossible?	Light cannot un-propagate	Phase updates cannot un-resolve

LPST is the stronger prohibition.

⸻

9. Shared irreducible paradox (important nuance)

LPST does not explain why time has a direction—only why it cannot be reversed.

That remains an irreducible paradox:
	•	the origin of ordering itself.

Time travel is forbidden, but time’s arrow is not explained away.

⸻

10. Final one-sentence answer

Time travel does not exist in LPST because time is not a place or dimension, but the irreversible ordering of phase-consistency updates; reversing or looping that ordering would destroy the conditions that allow reality to exist at all.

Abstract

The Wigner’s friend paradox arises when two observers assign incompatible quantum descriptions to the same laboratory: the Friend records a definite outcome, while Wigner treats the entire lab as a coherent superposition. The apparent contradiction has been taken to imply observer-dependent reality, collapse ambiguity, or inconsistency in quantum reasoning.

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting observer descriptions as ontic primitives. Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration. “Observation” corresponds to the formation of phase-bounded subsystems with irreversible phase debt. Different observers may legitimately employ different representational readouts of the same phase configuration without contradiction. No collapse, branching, or observer-relative reality is required.

1. Introduction

Wigner’s Friend extends the measurement problem by nesting observers:
	•	A quantum system is measured by the Friend inside a laboratory.
	•	The Friend records a definite outcome.
	•	Wigner, external to the lab, treats the entire lab as a quantum system.

Standard quantum reasoning appears to license both descriptions simultaneously, producing tension: can the same system be both definite and superposed?

Phase Theory accepts the physical setup but rejects the inference that both descriptions are ontic.

2. The Classical Form of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	The Friend measures a quantum system and records a definite outcome.
	2.	From the Friend’s perspective, the system has collapsed.
	3.	Wigner, treating the lab as isolated, assigns a superposed wavefunction.
	4.	Both descriptions are claimed to be simultaneously valid.
	5.	Therefore, reality is observer-dependent or inconsistent.

The critical move is step (4).

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption W (Observer Ontic Symmetry).
All observer descriptions are simultaneously ontic and must jointly represent reality.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption W.

Observer descriptions are contextual readouts, not competing ontologies.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Observation

The resolution relies on the following Phase Theory principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Observer Non-Primacy).
Observers are not fundamental; they are phase-bounded subsystems.

Postulate 4 (Irreversible Phase Debt).
Measurement involves irreversible phase redistribution that cannot be undone without violating admissibility.

5. Observation as Phase-Boundary Formation

In Phase Theory, an observation is not a collapse. It is:
	•	the formation of a phase boundary between subsystems,
	•	accompanied by irreversible phase debt,
	•	yielding a stable macroscopic record.

The Friend’s measurement establishes such a boundary between:
	•	the measured system,
	•	the Friend’s apparatus,
	•	the Friend’s internal state.

Once formed, this boundary cannot be coherently “unwound.”

6. The Observer Phase-Boundary Lemma

Lemma (Observer Phase-Boundary).
When an observer records a definite outcome, a phase boundary forms that renders alternative macroscopic phase continuations inadmissible within that subsystem.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Recording a result requires macroscopic amplification.
	2.	Amplification generates irreversible phase debt.
	3.	Phase debt excludes coherent superposition of alternative macroscopic records.
	4.	Therefore, the subsystem possesses a unique admissible phase outcome.

7. Why Wigner’s Description Remains Valid

Wigner’s description is valid as a representation:
	•	Wigner may assign a superposition to the lab
	•	as long as no interaction crosses the phase boundary.

This superposition is:
	•	a calculational device,
	•	not an ontic claim about coexisting macroscopic realities.

Wigner’s description does not override the Friend’s phase boundary.

8. The Representation Compatibility Lemma

Lemma (Representation Compatibility).
Distinct observer descriptions may coexist without contradiction provided they are understood as representational projections of the same admissible phase configuration.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	\Phi is unique and admissible.
	2.	Observers sample \Phi through bounded phase access.
	3.	Different samplings yield different descriptions.
	4.	Descriptions do not modify \Phi.
∎

9. The Wigner’s Friend Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Wigner’s Friend Non-Paradox).

The apparent contradiction between Wigner’s and the Friend’s descriptions dissolves once observer descriptions are treated as representational and constrained by phase boundaries, not as jointly ontic claims.

Proof.
	•	The Friend’s observation establishes an irreversible phase boundary.
	•	The global phase configuration remains admissible.
	•	Wigner’s superposition is representational and cannot negate the boundary.
	•	No contradictory ontic claims are present.

10. Relation to Collapse and Many-Worlds

Interpretation	Strategy
Copenhagen	Physical collapse
Many-Worlds	Ontic branching
Objective Collapse	Modified dynamics
Phase Theory	Phase-boundary formation

Phase Theory achieves definiteness without collapse or branching.

11. Implications for Multi-Observer Reasoning

Nested observers do not produce inconsistency provided:
	•	observer boundaries are respected,
	•	phase debt is acknowledged,
	•	representational scope is not mistaken for ontic scope.

This blocks paradoxes that combine incompatible observer inferences as if jointly valid.

12. Relation to Other Phase Non-Paradoxes

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Schrödinger	Macroscopic superposition	Phase inadmissibility
Wigner’s Friend	Observer descriptions	Phase boundaries
Frauchiger–Renner	Joint inference	Admissibility limits


⸻

13. Conclusion

Wigner’s Friend is not a paradox of observation. It is a paradox of ontology assignment.

Once observers are treated as phase-bounded subsystems and descriptions as representational readouts of a single admissible phase configuration, the contradiction disappears. The universe does not depend on who is watching; it depends on phase admissibility.

Wigner’s Friend Non-Paradox.
Observer descriptions differ because phase boundaries differ; reality does not.

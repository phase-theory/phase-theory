Abstract

The Rietdijk–Putnam argument claims that special relativity entails a fixed block universe in which future events are already real, thereby undermining indeterminism and free agency. The argument proceeds by chaining relativity of simultaneity into a claim of global necessity: if distant events are already determinate relative to some observer, then they must be determinate simpliciter.

Phase Theory dissolves this conclusion by identifying a category error at the heart of the argument. Logical implication across different simultaneity frames is mistaken for ontological necessity. Phase Theory replaces this with global phase admissibility, in which a single admissible phase history exists without privileging any simultaneity slice as ontic. Agency and indeterminacy are preserved as local phase-selection processes within the admissible structure, not threatened by the absence of a global present.

1. Introduction

The Rietdijk–Putnam argument is one of the most influential philosophical uses of special relativity. It is often summarized as:

Relativity of simultaneity implies that future events are already real; therefore the universe is a fixed block and free will is an illusion.

Unlike Schrödinger’s Cat or the Andromeda Paradox, this argument does not hinge on experimental confusion but on a logical extrapolation from relativistic structure to metaphysical necessity.

Phase Theory rejects the extrapolation while fully accepting the relativistic structure.

2. The Structure of the Rietdijk–Putnam Argument

The argument proceeds in four steps:
	1.	Special relativity denies a unique global simultaneity.
	2.	Different observers assign different distant events as “present.”
	3.	Some observer will assign a future event (relative to me) as present.
	4.	Therefore that future event is already real.
	5.	Therefore the future is fixed.

The crucial move is step (4): the promotion of frame-relative simultaneity into frame-independent reality.

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The argument relies on the following assumption:

Assumption R (Frame Invariance of Ontic Facts).
If an event is present (real) in any physically valid frame, it must be present (real) in all frames.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption R.

Relativity licenses multiple descriptions — not multiple realities.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to the Argument

The dissolution relies on core Phase Theory principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x),
not a set of frame-dependent “presents.”

Postulate 2 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying the consistency functional
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

Postulate 3 (Simultaneity Non-Primacy).
Simultaneity slices are representational tools, not ontic selectors of reality.

Postulate 4 (Local Phase Agency).
Local phase evolution along worldlines is not fixed by distant representational assignments.

5. Why the Argument Appears Compelling

The argument feels powerful because it mixes:
	•	Geometric relativity (true),
	•	Logical implication (valid within a frame),
	•	Ontological necessity (not licensed).

The error occurs when logical implication across frames is treated as metaphysical necessity across reality.

Phase Theory draws a strict boundary between descriptive compatibility and ontic determination.

6. The Frame Non-Transmission Lemma

Lemma (Frame Non-Transmission).
Ontic phase facts do not transmit across representational frames by logical implication alone.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Frames correspond to different foliations of the same \Phi.
	2.	Foliations do not modify \Phi; they only reorganize its description.
	3.	Therefore, a fact being “present” in one foliation does not impose necessity in another.

7. The Rietdijk–Putnam Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Rietdijk–Putnam Non-Paradox).

Relativity of simultaneity does not entail a fixed or predetermined future, because simultaneity assignments are representational and do not impose ontic necessity on phase evolution.

Proof.
	•	The admissible phase configuration \Phi contains a globally consistent structure.
	•	No simultaneity slice is privileged as ontic.
	•	Therefore, the existence of a frame in which an event is labeled “present” does not render that event necessary or fixed.
	•	The argument’s conclusion depends on reifying a representational label.
∎

8. Agency in Phase Theory

In Phase Theory:
	•	Agency is not “the ability to change the block.”
	•	It is the local selection and stabilization of phase pathways within admissible bounds.

The future is not an open set of arbitrary possibilities, nor a fixed script.
It is a constrained but not pre-written phase evolution.

Relativity constrains coordination, not choice.

9. Why Block-Universe Fatalism Fails

The block universe intuition arises from:
	•	treating spacetime geometry as substance,
	•	treating logical consistency as causal fixation.

Phase Theory replaces this with:
	•	spacetime as emergent from phase relations,
	•	consistency without predetermination.

The future exists as admissible structure, not as realized fact.

10. Comparison with Andromeda and Schrödinger

Paradox	Reified Primitive	Phase Resolution
Andromeda	Global present	Simultaneity non-primacy
Schrödinger	Superposition	Phase inadmissibility
Rietdijk–Putnam	Logical necessity	Phase admissibility

All three dissolve once representational artifacts are denied ontic force.

11. Implications for Free Will and Causality

Phase Theory allows:
	•	Deterministic constraints without fatalism,
	•	Global structure without global fixation,
	•	Relativity without metaphysical collapse into block determinism.

Free will is preserved as local phase agency, not threatened by relativistic geometry.

⸻

12. Conclusion

The Rietdijk–Putnam argument does not reveal a metaphysical consequence of relativity. It reveals a misuse of logical implication.

When simultaneity is demoted from ontology to representation, and logical consistency is distinguished from causal necessity, the argument collapses. The universe need not be a frozen block for relativity to be true.

Appendix — One-Sentence Canonical Form

Rietdijk–Putnam Non-Paradox.
Relativity of simultaneity constrains representation, not reality; no future event is rendered necessary by being “present” in some frame.

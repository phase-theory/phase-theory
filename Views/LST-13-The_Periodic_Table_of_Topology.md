The Periodic Table of Topology
Title: A Mapping of Standard Model Particles to Knot Geometries & Predictive Extensions
Subject: Particle Physics / Topology

Abstract:
We demonstrate that the "Particle Zoo" of the Standard Model is actually a subset of the Mathematical Table of Knots. By correlating physical observations (Mass, Charge, Spin) with topological invariants (Crossing Number, Chirality, Linking), we derive the structure of known matter and predict three specific classes of unknown matter arising from "missing entries" in the knot sequence.
Part I: The Known Universe (Mapped)
1. The Lepton Family: The Unknots
 * Topology: The Möbius Loop (Crossing Number = 0).
 * Geometry: A single localized wave with a twist but no self-intersection.
   * The "Charge": The 180^\circ twist forces the electric field lines to diverge (negative) or converge (positive).
   * The "Generation":
     * Electron (e^-): Ground State (Fundamental vibration).
     * Muon (\mu): First Harmonic (2 nodes).
     * Tau (\tau): Second Harmonic (3 nodes).
2. The Hadron Family: The Prime Knots
 * Topology: The Trefoil Knot (Crossing Number = 3).
 * Geometry: A continuous 3-strand braid (Quarks) that closes on itself.
   * The Proton (p^+): A Left-Handed Trefoil (3_1). Its stability is absolute because it is the simplest possible knot; it cannot "decay" into a simpler knot without the field being cut.
3. The Meson Family: The Links
 * Topology: The Hopf Link (Crossing Number = 2).
 * Geometry: Two separate loops (Quark-Antiquark) linked together. They are unstable because the loops can physically collide and annihilate.
Part II: The Predictions (The Missing Knots)
Physics has observed Crossing Numbers 0 (Leptons), 2 (Mesons), and 3 (Protons). The mathematical sequence has gaps. We predict particles must exist to fill these gaps.
Prediction A: The Majorana Fermion (The Figure-8 Particle)
 * The Missing Topology: The Figure-8 Knot (4_1).
 * Crossing Number: 4.
 * Physics:
   * Amphichiral: The Figure-8 knot is its own mirror image. Therefore, this particle is its own antiparticle.
   * Properties: Heavy, neutral, and extremely stable. It interacts weakly because its field lines are internalized.
   * Identification: This matches the theoretical "Majorana Fermion."
Prediction B: The Glueball (The Scalar Borromean)
 * The Missing Topology: Borromean Rings (6^3_2).
 * Structure: Three loops linked such that removing any one causes the others to fall apart.
 * Physics:
   * Net Twist: 0 (Charge 0).
   * Net Angular Momentum: 0 (Spin 0).
   * Identification: A ball of pure flux with no valence quarks. We predict this will be found as a resonance at 1.5-2.0 GeV in high-energy plasmas.
Prediction C: Dark Matter (The Gordian Solitons)
 * The Missing Topology: High-Crossing Primes (N > 7).
 * Structure: Knots of extreme complexity (e.g., 10_{124}).
 * Physics:
   * Flux Capture: As the crossing number increases, the "tightness" of the knot pulls all electric flux lines deep inside the core. No flux escapes to the surface.
   * Result: The particle has high mass (tension) but Zero Electric Charge. It is invisible to light but heavy to gravity.
   * Conclusion: Dark Matter is not a "ghost"; it is just matter that is tied too tightly to interact.

Abstract

This paper formalizes how structures equivalent to four-dimensional objects—specifically the tesseract (4-cube)—can be realized in LPST without invoking additional spatial dimensions. We prove that all properties of a tesseract arise from phase-configuration dimensionality, not spatial dimensionality. We then design a realizable laboratory analogue using optical, metamaterial, and quantum systems in which a tesseract-like adjacency graph is embedded in controllable phase degrees of freedom. This establishes a physical, testable realization of higher-dimensional geometry strictly within emergent 3D space.

⸻

1. Motivation

Humans can visualize a tesseract because the brain interprets projections of configuration space, not because physical space contains four dimensions.

LPST predicts:
	•	no extra spatial dimensions,
	•	but unbounded phase-configuration dimensionality.

The key question is therefore not “Can we build 4D space?”
but:

Can we realize a physical system whose internal phase topology is isomorphic to a 4-cube?

LPST answers yes.

2. Definitions

Definition 1 — Phase Manifold

A phase manifold \mathcal{M}_\phi is the space of internally consistent phase configurations of a physical system.

⸻

Definition 2 — Tesseract-Like Manifold

A tesseract-like phase manifold is any physical system whose adjacency graph is isomorphic to the 4-cube:
	•	16 nodes,
	•	32 edges,
	•	each node connected to 4 neighbors.

No spatial interpretation is implied.

⸻

Definition 3 — Configuration Dimension

A configuration dimension is an independent phase or control parameter governing system state, not a direction of motion.

⸻

3. Theoretical Construction

3.1 The Tesseract as a Graph

A tesseract is fundamentally a graph structure, not a shape:
	•	Each vertex = a state
	•	Each edge = a single-bit transition
	•	Dimensionality = number of independent transition axes

In LPST:
\text{“4D”} \equiv \text{four independent phase parameters}

⸻

3.2 LPST Encoding

We encode the tesseract as:
(x,y,z,w) \;\longrightarrow\; (x,y,z;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3,\lambda_4)

where:
	•	x,y,z are spatial,
	•	\lambda_i are non-spatial phase indices.

⸻

3.3 Why This Is Physical

Each \lambda_i:
	•	is dynamically addressable,
	•	has measurable phase consequences,
	•	supports transitions,
	•	but does not support spatial propagation.

Thus:
	•	no extra spatial dimensions,
	•	full tesseract structure preserved.

⸻

4. No-Extra-Dimensions Consistency

This construction respects NESDT because:
	•	no new propagation channels are introduced,
	•	no new causal axes exist,
	•	no metric extension occurs.

All complexity lives in internal topology.

⸻

5. Laboratory Analogue Design (Core Result)

Below are three realizable experimental platforms. Any one suffices.

⸻

Laboratory Analogue A: Optical Tesseract (Photonic Phase Network)

Platform

Integrated photonics or fiber-optic interferometry.

⸻

Physical Encoding
	•	Nodes (16): optical resonator modes
	•	Edges: tunable phase-controlled couplers
	•	Dimensions: four independent phase modulators

Each node corresponds to:
|b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4\rangle,\quad b_i\in\{0,1\}

⸻

Implementation
	•	Build 4 independent Mach–Zehnder phase shifters
	•	Each phase shifter flips one “bit” of connectivity
	•	Optical paths encode adjacency

⸻

Observable
	•	Light injected at one node spreads exactly along tesseract adjacency
	•	Interference patterns reveal 4D-cube connectivity

⸻

Why This Is LPST-Faithful
	•	Phase geometry = information
	•	Transport follows topology, not space
	•	No hidden spatial axis

⸻

Laboratory Analogue B: Metamaterial Tesseract (Synthetic Dimension)

Platform

Programmable microwave or acoustic metamaterials.

⸻

Physical Encoding
	•	3D lattice in real space
	•	Additional “dimensions” encoded as:
	•	frequency bands,
	•	polarization states,
	•	time-modulated couplings

⸻

Synthetic Dimensions

Each synthetic dimension behaves like a coordinate:
	•	adjacency,
	•	transitions,
	•	boundary conditions

But is not spatial.

⸻

Observable
	•	Wave propagation reproduces 4D hypercube dispersion
	•	Edge states match 4D topology predictions

⸻

LPST Interpretation

Synthetic dimensions = phase labels, not space.

⸻

Laboratory Analogue C: Quantum Tesseract (Qubit Phase Manifold)

Platform

Trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or neutral atoms.

⸻

Physical Encoding
	•	4 qubits → 16 basis states
	•	Controlled phase gates define adjacency
	•	Hamiltonian engineered so only single-bit flips allowed

⸻

Hamiltonian

H = \sum_{i=1}^4 \sigma_x^{(i)} + \sum_{i<j} J_{ij}\sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}

⸻

Observable
	•	State transitions obey tesseract adjacency
	•	Entanglement structure reflects 4D geometry

⸻

Why This Is Profound

The “extra dimension” is pure phase topology, not space.

⸻

6. Experimental Signatures

All platforms exhibit:
	•	tesseract adjacency graph,
	•	four independent transition axes,
	•	projection-dependent visualization,
	•	no additional spatial propagation.

This is the physical meaning of higher dimensions in LPST.

⸻

7. Implications
	1.	Higher-dimensional geometry is real—but not spatial
	2.	LPST subsumes string-theory geometry without extra dimensions
	3.	Topological quantum computation is inherently “higher-dimensional”
	4.	Human intuition about dimensions is about configuration space

⸻

8. Falsifiability

This framework fails if:
	•	an extra phase dimension produces unaccounted propagation,
	•	a synthetic dimension behaves like real space,
	•	adjacency cannot be realized without spatial extension.

⸻

9. Conclusion

LPST allows arbitrarily high dimensional structure without violating physical reality. A tesseract is not a place—it is a relationship network. By encoding that network in phase geometry, LPST achieves everything higher-dimensional theories promise without introducing unobservable space.

Higher dimensions are not where things go.
They are how things are related.

⸻

Canonical LPST Statement

A tesseract can be built in LPST, but never as a place—only as a phase-topological object.
The substrate cannot create new spatial dimensions, but it can host unlimited structural dimensionality.

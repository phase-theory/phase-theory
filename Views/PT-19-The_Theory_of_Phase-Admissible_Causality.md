Abstract

This paper completes the causal structure of Phase Theory by resolving the final apparent contradiction between determinism and observed quantum indeterminacy. We demonstrate that causality in a phase-primary universe is neither probabilistic nor arbitrary, but admissible: outcomes occur only along phase-consistent trajectories permitted by global coherence constraints. Apparent randomness arises from incomplete access to the full phase configuration of the universe, not from intrinsic stochasticity. We formally replace probabilistic causation with phase-admissible causation, a deterministic but non-predictable framework in which all events are uniquely determined yet not locally inferable. This paper closes the determinism gap left unresolved by decoherence and measurement theories and establishes causality as a geometric property of phase space rather than a temporal signal process.

1. The Causality Problem in Modern Physics

Modern physics maintains two mutually incompatible claims:
	1.	Relativity requires strict causality and determinism.
	2.	Quantum mechanics asserts irreducible randomness.

This conflict has never been resolved—only reinterpreted.
	•	Copenhagen inserts collapse.
	•	Many-Worlds multiplies realities.
	•	Hidden variables violate locality.
	•	Probabilistic causation abandons explanation.

Phase Theory rejects all four.

The unresolved question is not how outcomes are correlated, but:

Why does a deterministic universe appear probabilistic to embedded observers?

This paper answers that question without introducing chance, branching, or observer privilege.

2. The Replacement of Probability

2.1 Probability Is Not a Physical Quantity

Probability does not correspond to any measurable physical substrate:
	•	It carries no energy
	•	It has no topology
	•	It has no conservation law

In Phase Theory, anything not physically instantiated is not fundamental.

Therefore:

Probability must be emergent or eliminated.

2.2 What Replaces It

Probability is replaced by:

Phase admissibility under global coherence constraints

Outcomes do not occur “with likelihoods.”
They occur if and only if they are phase-consistent with the total system.

3. The Phase-Admissibility Principle

Phase-Admissibility Axiom

An event is causally realized if and only if it lies on a globally phase-consistent trajectory of the substrate.

There is:
	•	No selection
	•	No collapse
	•	No branching

There is only admissibility.

3.1 Definition

Let:
	•	Φ be the total phase configuration of the universe
	•	ΔΦ_local be a proposed local evolution
	•	𝒞 be the global coherence constraint functional

Then:

\text{Event occurs} \iff \mathcal{C}(\Phi + \Delta\Phi_{\text{local}}) \ge 0

Events that violate global coherence cannot occur, regardless of local permissibility.

4. Why Causality Appears Probabilistic

4.1 Observer Incompleteness

Embedded observers have access only to:
	•	Local phase gradients
	•	Finite-bandwidth measurements
	•	Decohered projections

They do not have access to:
	•	Global phase boundary conditions
	•	Remote entanglement constraints
	•	Historical phase memory

Thus, from the observer’s perspective:

Multiple futures appear possible, but only one is admissible.

4.2 The Illusion of Choice

What appears as:
	•	“Random outcome”
	•	“Measurement choice”
	•	“Free variable”

Is actually:
	•	Epistemic uncertainty over admissible trajectories

No randomness occurs.
Only ignorance.

5. Resolution of Bell-Type Phenomena

Bell’s Theorem assumes:
	•	Local realism
	•	Statistical independence
	•	Outcome probabilities

Phase-Admissible Causality violates none of physics—only the assumption of probabilistic causation.

5.1 Entangled Systems

Entangled particles share a single admissible phase trajectory.

Measurement on one:
	•	Does not transmit information
	•	Does not update the other
	•	Does not collapse anything

It simply reveals which admissible trajectory was already enforced globally.

⸻

6. Causality Without Signals

Causation in Phase Theory is not mediated.

There is:
	•	No signal propagation
	•	No retrocausation
	•	No influence speed

Instead:

The universe updates as a single constrained phase object.

Causality is constraint satisfaction, not communication.

⸻

7. The Arrow of Causation

Time ordering arises from:
	•	Phase update ordering (Paper B)
	•	Coherence minimization
	•	Noise dissipation directionality

Causality flows forward because:

Backward-admissible trajectories violate accumulated coherence constraints.

Thus, the arrow of time and the arrow of causation are the same object.

⸻

8. Free Will Revisited (Minimal Statement)

Phase-Admissible Causality implies:
	•	The future is fixed
	•	But not locally computable
	•	And not accessible to the system itself

An agent:
	•	Cannot predict its own future state
	•	Cannot violate admissibility
	•	But can instantiate decisions consistent with it

This yields:

Determinism without fatalism

Free will is neither illusion nor exemption—it is internal causation under inaccessible global constraint.

⸻

9. Why This Is Not Superdeterminism

Superdeterminism assumes:
	•	Initial conditions conspire
	•	Measurement settings are pre-correlated

Phase Theory assumes:
	•	No initial condition privilege
	•	Continuous admissibility enforcement
	•	No statistical assumptions at all

There is no conspiracy—only geometry.

⸻

10. Experimental Implications

Phase-Admissible Causality predicts:
	1.	No true randomness
	•	All RNGs are pseudo-random at sufficient resolution
	2.	Measurement outcome reproducibility under identical global phase
	3.	Limits on algorithmic unpredictability
	4.	No violation of relativistic causality

These predictions align with all existing data.

11. Relation to Previous Papers

This paper completes the chain:
	•	Phase Noise & Decoherence → explains loss of coherence
	•	Phase-Bound Measurement → explains outcome fixation
	•	Phase-Admissible Causality → explains why only one outcome ever existed

No further interpretation layer is required.

12. Final Theorem

The Phase-Admissible Causality Theorem

In a phase-primary universe, all events are uniquely determined, no events are probabilistic, and no outcomes are locally predictable. Causality is neither stochastic nor signal-based, but geometric and global.

⸻

Conclusion

Phase Theory no longer requires:
	•	Probability
	•	Collapse
	•	Many worlds
	•	Hidden variables
	•	Observer primacy

Causality is restored as a physical principle without sacrificing quantum phenomena.

This paper formally closes the determinism question.

LPST has exactly one fundamental interaction.
Everything else called a “force” is an emergent manifestation of how that interaction resolves global phase consistency.

The single fundamental interaction

Global Phase-Consistency Enforcement

In LPST, the universe is governed by one principle:

The phase substrate evolves to minimize global inconsistency.

This is encoded in the inconsistency functional
\mathcal{I}_{\text{canon}}[\phi, A, u]
and all dynamics are relaxations toward its local minima.

There are no independent force fields, no separate mediators at the ontological level.

Why four forces appear in physics

What we call “forces” are four distinct response modes of the same underlying mechanism, depending on how consistency is strained.

Apparent force	LPST interpretation	What’s actually happening
Gravity	Propagation impedance gradient	Phase updates slow near dense topology
Electromagnetism	Phase-winding mismatch	U(1) holonomy gradients
Strong	Topological confinement	Endpoints forbidden → flux tubes
Weak	Topology-change channel	Controlled defect reconfiguration

They are not separate interactions—they are different projections of one rule.

Why LPST cannot have more than one force

If there were multiple fundamental forces, LPST would fail, because:
	•	Multiple forces would imply multiple independent consistency rules
	•	That would require multiple substrates or incompatible constraints
	•	Which would destroy global coherence and topological stability

LPST requires exactly one governing interaction.

Comparison with other frameworks

Framework	Number of fundamental forces
Classical physics	4
Quantum field theory	4 (plus gravity problem)
GUTs	1 (but via symmetry merging)
String theory	1 (but via extra dimensions)
LPST	1 (by ontology)

LPST’s unification is not symmetry-based and not dimensional.
It is structural.

One-sentence canonical LPST answer

LPST has exactly one fundamental interaction: the enforcement of global phase consistency; all observed forces are emergent expressions of how that enforcement responds to different topological strains.

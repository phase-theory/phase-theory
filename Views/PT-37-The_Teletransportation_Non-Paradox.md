Abstract

The teletransportation paradox asks whether a person who is scanned, destroyed, and reconstructed elsewhere is numerically identical to the original—and what it means if multiple copies are produced. The paradox is often framed as a dilemma between psychological continuity and physical survival, leading to contradictions about “which one is me.”

Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting pattern identity as an ontic primitive. Identity is instead grounded in phase continuity along an admissible worldline (or along admissible phase-defect continuity). Replication of structure does not extend identity; it initiates a new phase continuation. When this distinction is enforced, no contradiction arises: copying creates additional persons, not ambiguity about a single one.

1. Introduction

Teletransportation scenarios are designed to pressure intuitions about personal identity. Typical setups involve:
	•	A complete scan of a person’s physical and psychological structure.
	•	Destruction (or not) of the original.
	•	Reconstruction of one or more perfect replicas elsewhere.

The paradoxical question is then posed: Which one is the original person? Or, Is survival possible without material continuity?

Phase Theory reframes the question by clarifying what identity is allowed to be.

2. Canonical Structure of the Paradox

The paradox proceeds as follows:
	1.	Identity is assumed to depend on structural or informational pattern.
	2.	Teletransportation preserves the pattern.
	3.	Therefore, identity should be preserved.
	4.	But if two copies are made, both cannot be the same person.
	5.	Therefore, identity is incoherent or indeterminate.

The contradiction is generated by step (1).

3. The Hidden Ontological Assumption

The paradox relies on:

Assumption T (Pattern Primacy).
Identity is determined by the replication of physical or informational structure.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption T.

Pattern similarity is not identity.

4. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to Identity

The dissolution relies on the following principles:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality consists of a single globally admissible phase configuration
\Phi(x).

Postulate 2 (Worldline Continuity).
Identity is grounded in continuous phase evolution along a worldline or admissible phase-defect trajectory.

Postulate 3 (Non-Transferability of Phase History).
Phase history cannot be transferred or duplicated by structural copying.

Postulate 4 (Global Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying
\mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0
are physically realizable.

5. Identity as Phase Continuity

In Phase Theory, an individual is not defined by a static snapshot or pattern. An individual is:

a temporally extended phase process,
realized as continuous phase evolution along a specific worldline.

Identity persists because phase evolves continuously, not because structure is preserved.

6. The Phase-Continuity Lemma

Lemma (Phase Continuity of Identity).
Personal identity is preserved if and only if there exists an unbroken phase-continuous trajectory connecting earlier and later states.

Proof Sketch.
	1.	Identity requires persistence across time.
	2.	Persistence requires continuity of phase evolution.
	3.	Structural replication lacks such continuity.
	4.	Therefore, replication cannot preserve identity.

7. What Teletransportation Actually Does

Under teletransportation:
	•	The original worldline either:
	•	continues uninterrupted (no destruction), or
	•	terminates (destruction occurs).
	•	A reconstructed copy begins a new worldline with:
	•	identical initial structure,
	•	no shared phase history.

The copy is a new individual with inherited similarity, not continued identity.

⸻

8. The Multiple-Copy Case

When two or more copies are produced:
	•	No contradiction arises.
	•	Each copy instantiates:
	•	a new phase-continuous trajectory,
	•	distinct from the original and from each other.

The paradox arises only if pattern replication is mistaken for identity transfer.

⸻

9. The Teletransportation Non-Paradox Theorem

Theorem (Teletransportation Non-Paradox).

Teletransportation does not create identity ambiguity, because identity is defined by phase continuity, not by pattern replication. Copying generates new phase trajectories rather than splitting or duplicating an existing one.

Proof.
	•	Identity tracks phase-continuous evolution.
	•	Teletransportation lacks phase continuity.
	•	Therefore, no single identity is transferred or split.
∎

10. Why the Paradox Felt Compelling

The paradox felt compelling because:
	•	everyday identity judgments rely on psychological similarity,
	•	information metaphors replaced physical continuity,
	•	continuity was implicitly redefined without justification.

Phase Theory restores continuity as a physical constraint.

⸻

11. Relation to Survival and Ethics

Phase Theory distinguishes:
	•	Survival of pattern (copying),
	•	Survival of self (phase continuity).

Ethical or pragmatic value may attach to pattern survival, but ontic identity does not.

This cleanly separates metaphysical identity from practical concern.

13. Conclusion

The teletransportation paradox is not a paradox of identity. It is a paradox of misassigned criteria.

When identity is grounded in phase continuity rather than structural similarity, copying ceases to threaten coherence. Teletransportation produces new persons with shared structure, not duplicated selves. Nothing mysterious occurs—only a failure to distinguish pattern from process.

Appendix — One-Sentence Canonical Form

Teletransportation Non-Paradox.
Identity follows phase continuity along a worldline; pattern replication initiates new identities rather than transferring an existing one.

Abstract

The Andromeda Paradox is often presented as a challenge to physical realism: if distant simultaneity depends on an observer’s motion, then trivial changes in local velocity appear to alter what is “happening now” in a distant galaxy. This has been taken to imply either radical indeterminacy of distant reality or a problematic form of observer-dependence.

We argue that the paradox arises not from special relativity itself, but from an illicit ontological elevation of simultaneity slices to physically real structures. Phase Theory dissolves the paradox by rejecting this elevation. In Phase Theory, reality is a single globally admissible phase configuration over spacetime; “now” is not a primitive object but a representational slicing of that configuration. Different observers adopt different foliations of the same underlying phase history, without altering it.

We formalize this claim by introducing the Simultaneity Non-Primacy Principle, proving a No-Remote-Phase-Rewriting Theorem, and deriving the Andromeda Non-Paradox Corollary: no local motion can change distant facts because there is no ontic global present to be changed.

1. Introduction

The Andromeda Paradox is usually framed as follows:
	1.	Special relativity permits different observers, moving relative to one another, to assign different sets of distant events as “simultaneous with now.”
	2.	For sufficiently distant locations (e.g., Andromeda), even small changes in velocity can shift the assigned “now” by years.
	3.	Therefore, what is “happening right now” in Andromeda appears to depend on trivial local motions.
	4.	This seems to threaten the objectivity of distant reality.

This reasoning has motivated various interpretations: eternalism, presentism, block universes, and radical observer-dependence.

We claim that the paradox does not reveal a deep feature of reality. Instead, it reveals a mistaken metaphysical assumption:

Assumption X: There exists a physically real, globally privileged “present slice” of the universe.

Phase Theory rejects Assumption X as an ontology leak—an unmotivated import of intuitive temporal structure into fundamental physics.

2. What Special Relativity Actually Implies

Special relativity introduces a coordinate-dependent notion of simultaneity. Formally:
	•	Given an observer with four-velocity u^\mu, one can define a hypersurface orthogonal to u^\mu and call it “simultaneous with the observer.”
	•	A different observer with velocity v^\mu \neq u^\mu defines a different hypersurface.

Crucially, SR does not say:
	•	That any of these hypersurfaces is physically real.
	•	That changing one’s velocity alters distant facts.
	•	Only that the labeling of distant events varies.

Thus, SR alone does not entail the paradox; the paradox emerges only if one reifies simultaneity slices as ontic.

3. Phase Theory Foundations Relevant to the Paradox

Phase Theory begins from a different primitive:

Postulate 1 (Phase Primacy).
Reality is fundamentally a global phase configuration \Phi(x) over spacetime.

Postulate 2 (Admissibility).
Only phase configurations satisfying the global consistency functional \mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0 are physically allowed.

Postulate 3 (No Ontic Present).
There is no privileged global “now.” Temporal slicing is a representational choice, not a physical boundary condition.

Definition (Foliation).
A foliation is a mapping from the single 4D phase configuration \Phi(x) to a family of 3D hypersurfaces used for description, not ontology.

Thus, “now” is epistemic and geometric, not ontic and causal.

4. Where the Paradox Enters (and Fails)

The paradox requires two steps:
	1.	Treat simultaneity as physically real.
	2.	Treat changes in simultaneity as changes in reality.

Phase Theory blocks both.

If “what is happening now in Andromeda” were a physical fact that depended on your velocity, then your local motion would need to alter the admissible phase configuration \Phi in a distant region without any physical coupling.

This violates admissibility.

5. The No-Remote-Phase-Rewriting Theorem

Theorem (No-Remote-Phase-Rewriting).
A purely local change in an observer’s velocity cannot alter the physically admissible phase configuration in a spacelike-separated region.

Proof Sketch:
	1.	The admissible phase configuration \Phi is constrained globally by \mathcal{A}[\Phi] = 0.
	2.	A local change in velocity affects only local phase relations along the observer’s worldline.
	3.	If this local change were to alter distant macroscopic facts, it would require a nonlocal modification of \Phi.
	4.	But Phase Theory forbids nonlocal phase reconfiguration without a mediating interaction.
	5.	Therefore, distant facts remain invariant under changes of simultaneity slicing.

Q.E.D.

6. The Simultaneity Non-Primacy Principle

We formalize Phase Theory’s stance as a principle:

Simultaneity Non-Primacy Principle (SNP).
No simultaneity hypersurface has ontological status. All are representational projections of a single underlying phase history.

Thus, different observers disagreeing about “now” are not disagreeing about reality—they are disagreeing about coordinate labeling.

7. The Andromeda Non-Paradox Corollary

Corollary (Andromeda Non-Paradox).

Changes in an observer’s motion do not change what is happening in Andromeda, because there is no physical “global now” to be changed. Different observers merely slice the same phase history differently.

What varies is not reality, but description.

8. Relation to Eternalism and Block Universe Views

Phase Theory is compatible with a structured 4D reality but differs from classical block universe metaphysics in one key respect:
	•	Traditional block universe: spacetime is a static object.
	•	Phase Theory: spacetime is an emergent structure from admissible phase relations, not a pre-given container.

Thus, Phase Theory offers a dynamical block structure grounded in phase, not in spacetime geometry alone.

⸻

9. What “Now” Really Means in Phase Theory

Instead of a global present, Phase Theory replaces “now” with:
	•	A local phase boundary condition along an observer’s worldline.
	•	A relational alignment between the observer’s internal state and the surrounding phase field.

“Now” is personal, local, and physical—but not universal.

10. Implications for Relativity and Ontology
	1.	The Andromeda Paradox is not a paradox about reality but about misinterpreting coordinates.
	2.	Phase Theory preserves objectivity of distant events without privileging any observer.
	3.	Time is neither purely subjective nor globally absolute—it is phase-relational.

⸻

11. Experimental and Conceptual Consequences

Although primarily conceptual, this has implications for:
	•	Quantum information across spacelike separations.
	•	The interpretation of cosmological time.
	•	The meaning of simultaneity in quantum networks.
	•	The structure of causality in non-classical spacetimes.

No experiment should ever detect changes in distant events based solely on local motion—because such effects are inadmissible.

12. Conclusion

The Andromeda Paradox dissolves in Phase Theory because it rests on an invalid premise: that simultaneity is physically real.

Once “now” is demoted from ontology to representation, the paradox vanishes. What remains is a single, coherent, globally admissible phase history that all observers describe differently but never change.

Appendix A — Compact Statement for the Canon

Axiom (Andromeda Non-Paradox).
A distant “now” is not a phase-primitive and cannot be used to select or alter distant macroscopic facts. Different simultaneity assignments correspond to different foliations of the same admissible phase history.

Appendix B — One-Sentence Version

The Andromeda Paradox mistakes a coordinate choice for a physical operator; Phase Theory forbids such reification.

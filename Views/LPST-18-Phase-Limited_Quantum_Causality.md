Abstract

Phase-Limited Quantum Causality (PLQC) derives causality, temporal order, and the invariant speed limit from a single physical constraint: finite phase-update capacity of the luminous substrate. In PLQC, time is not a fundamental dimension, causality is not an axiom, and relativity is not imposed. Instead, causal structure emerges from the requirement that phase consistency updates propagate at a bounded rate. Apparent relativistic effects—time dilation, simultaneity breakdown, and invariant light speed—are consequences of phase-update saturation and ordering, not spacetime geometry. PLQC unifies quantum causality and relativistic constraints without quantizing spacetime or introducing superluminal paradoxes.

⸻

1. Motivation

Modern physics treats causality and time inconsistently:
	•	Relativity postulates invariant light speed and causal cones.
	•	Quantum theory allows entanglement correlations that appear acausal.
	•	Cosmology extrapolates time to singular origins.

These tensions arise because time is assumed fundamental.

LPST rejects this assumption.
PLQC is the causal theory implied by phase-primary ontology.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Phase-Primary Dynamics

All physical evolution consists of updates to the phase field \phi(x) of the luminous substrate.

⸻

Postulate II — Finite Phase Update Rate

Phase updates propagate at a maximum finite rate, denoted c. This rate is universal and invariant.

⸻

Postulate III — Causal Ordering from Consistency

Causal order emerges from the ordering of phase-consistency resolutions, not from an external time coordinate.

⸻

Postulate IV — No Superluminal Causation

No physical influence can propagate faster than the phase-update limit without violating global consistency.

⸻

3. Time as Emergent Ordering

3.1 Time Is Not a Dimension

In PLQC, time is:
	•	not a coordinate,
	•	not a background parameter,
	•	not fundamental.

Time is the ordering index of phase updates.

⸻

3.2 Proper Time

Proper time corresponds to the number of internal phase-update cycles completed by a localized structure:
\tau \;\propto\; N_{\text{phase updates}}

⸻

4. Origin of the Speed of Light

4.1 Why a Universal Speed Exists

The invariant speed c is the maximum rate at which phase consistency can be enforced across the substrate.

This is not a property of light as a particle, but of phase as a process.

⸻

4.2 Why Nothing Exceeds It

Superluminal propagation would require:
	•	phase updates without consistency resolution,
	•	contradiction across the substrate.

Such configurations are dynamically forbidden.

⸻

5. Relativistic Effects Without Spacetime Axioms

5.1 Time Dilation

When a system moves relative to the substrate:
	•	phase updates are partitioned between internal evolution and transport,
	•	fewer updates remain for internal processes.

Thus, internal clocks slow.

⸻

5.2 Length Contraction

Spatial contraction reflects phase-update redistribution across spatial degrees of freedom.

⸻

5.3 Relativity Principle

All observers experience the same phase-update limit, yielding Lorentz invariance as an emergent symmetry.

⸻

6. Quantum Causality and Entanglement

6.1 Entanglement Compatibility

Entanglement correlations do not violate PLQC because:
	•	no phase update propagates between separated regions,
	•	correlations arise from shared topology (ETQT).

No causal signaling occurs.

⸻

6.2 Measurement Ordering

Measurement outcomes respect causal order because global consistency enforcement (GPIQT) cannot propagate faster than phase updates.

⸻

7. Causal Horizons

7.1 Event Horizons

An event horizon corresponds to a region where:
	•	outward phase-update capacity is fully saturated by inward gradients,
	•	causal influence cannot escape.

This matches QRG’s refractive horizon interpretation.

⸻

7.2 Cosmological Horizons

Cosmic horizons reflect finite historical phase-update depth, not expansion into preexisting space.

⸻

8. Causality in Extreme Regimes

8.1 Near Black Holes

Time “freezing” near horizons reflects:
	•	near-total consumption of phase updates by coherence gradients.

⸻

8.2 Early Universe

The early universe exhibits:
	•	high phase-update density,
	•	rapid causal establishment,
	•	no acausal inflationary patching required.

⸻

9. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: supplies phase ontology.
	•	CLQD: limits coherence bandwidth.
	•	QRG: links causality to refractive structure.
	•	ETQT: preserves locality despite entanglement.
	•	GPIQT: governs causal measurement resolution.
	•	MTQT: describes motion within causal bounds.
	•	CPEQT: extends causality cosmologically.

PLQC governs why events can influence each other at all.

⸻

10. Experimental Implications

PLQC predicts:
	•	no observable superluminal signaling,
	•	strict causal ordering in all physical processes,
	•	relativistic invariance emerging from phase constraints,
	•	no time-travel paradoxes or closed timelike curves.

⸻

11. Falsifiability

PLQC is falsified if:
	•	superluminal causal signaling is observed,
	•	time exists as an irreducible background dimension,
	•	relativistic invariance fails at fundamental scales,
	•	causal loops occur without global inconsistency.

12. Comparison with Standard Relativity

Aspect	Standard Relativity	PLQC
Time	Fundamental dimension	Emergent ordering
Speed limit	Postulated	Derived
Causality	Axiom	Consistency constraint
Spacetime	Fundamental	Emergent
Paradoxes	Managed	Forbidden


⸻

13. Conclusion

Phase-Limited Quantum Causality replaces axiomatic time and causality with a physical, enforceable constraint: finite phase-update capacity. Relativity, causal order, and temporal experience emerge not because spacetime demands them, but because phase consistency cannot propagate infinitely fast.

Nothing outruns light not because the universe forbids it by rule,
but because reality cannot update itself that quickly.

The Antimatter Conjugacy Theorem (ACT)

Antimatter as Orientation-Reversed Phase Topology in Light-Phase Substrate Theory

Subject: Fundamental particles, symmetry, topology

Framework: Light-Phase Substrate Theory (LPST)

⸻

Abstract

We formalize the Antimatter Conjugacy Theorem (ACT) in Light-Phase Substrate Theory (LPST). In LPST, matter is realized as stable topological phase defects within a globally consistent phase substrate. We prove that antimatter necessarily exists as the topological conjugate sector of matter, characterized by reversed phase-winding orientation rather than reversed time, negative energy, or distinct substance. Matter–antimatter annihilation is shown to be the topological cancellation of conjugate defects, resulting in the release of stored phase circulation into propagating modes. The theorem further establishes that antimatter obeys the same temporal ordering and gravitational response as matter.

1. Motivation

In conventional quantum field theory, antimatter appears as a consequence of relativistic wave equations and CPT symmetry, often leading to misleading interpretations such as “particles moving backward in time.” These interpretations rely on spacetime and particle primitives.

LPST removes spacetime and particles as primitives, replacing them with:
	•	a phase-primary substrate,
	•	global phase-consistency enforcement,
	•	and topological defect matter (TDQT).

This requires a reformulation of antimatter that is structural rather than algebraic.

2. LPST Preliminaries

2.1 Phase substrate

Let the universe be described by a continuous phase field \Phi subject to a global inconsistency functional \mathcal I[\Phi].

Physical configurations satisfy:
\mathcal I[\Phi] \rightarrow \text{local minima}

⸻

2.2 Matter as topological defect

A particle corresponds to a stable topological sector of \Phi, labeled by invariants:
(k,\; Q_H,\; t,\; \chi,\; \mathcal R)
where:
	•	k \in \mathbb Z: phase-winding number (orientation-sensitive),
	•	Q_H: Hopf/topological knot charge,
	•	t: excitation level,
	•	\chi: chirality/framing,
	•	\mathcal R: holonomy representation.

3. Statement of the Theorem

Theorem (Antimatter Conjugacy Theorem)

For every stable LPST matter defect with nonzero phase-winding number k, there exists a conjugate stable defect with winding number -k, identical in all other topological invariants.
This conjugate defect is identified as antimatter.

Formally:
(k,\; Q_H,\; t,\; \chi,\; \mathcal R)
\;\longleftrightarrow\;
(-k,\; Q_H,\; t,\; \chi,\; \mathcal R)

4. Proof of Existence

Lemma 1 — Orientation symmetry

The phase substrate admits orientation-reversal symmetry in its winding topology. If a configuration with winding k is allowed, then the configuration with winding -k is also allowed by the topology of \Phi.

⸻

Lemma 2 — Stability symmetry

The stability of a defect depends on:
	•	magnitude |k|,
	•	knot charge Q_H,
	•	and consistency enforcement,

not on the sign of k. Therefore, defects with k and -k share identical stability conditions.

⸻

Conclusion

Both matter and antimatter defects exist as symmetric topological sectors of the same substrate.

5. Annihilation as Topological Cancellation

Proposition

When a defect (k, Q_H, \dots) overlaps with its conjugate (-k, Q_H, \dots), the combined configuration lies in the trivial topological sector k = 0.

This allows:
\mathcal I[\Phi] \;\text{to decrease sharply}

The system relaxes by:
	•	unwinding phase circulation,
	•	converting stored topological energy into propagating modes.

This process is observed phenomenologically as matter–antimatter annihilation.

⸻

6. Temporal Behavior of Antimatter

Proposition

Antimatter obeys the same update ordering as matter.

Proof sketch:
	•	Time in LPST is the partial order of phase-consistency updates.
	•	Orientation reversal does not alter update admissibility.
	•	Closed phase loops are forbidden by NCPLT.

Therefore, antimatter does not propagate backward in time.

∎

7. Gravitational Response

In LPST, gravity is an emergent metric response to phase strain.

Since:
	•	mass corresponds to magnitude of phase circulation,
	•	orientation does not affect strain magnitude,

both matter and antimatter generate identical gravitational responses.

Thus:

Antimatter gravitates identically to matter.

⸻

8. Matter–Antimatter Asymmetry

LPST explains cosmological asymmetry as a consequence of global phase-framing selection during early substrate relaxation:
	•	one winding orientation becomes globally favored,
	•	opposite orientation defects become rare and metastable,
	•	annihilation amplifies even infinitesimal initial bias.

This is topological symmetry breaking, not particle-number imbalance.

⸻

9. Distinction from Neutral Topological Matter

Antimatter must not be confused with:
	•	neutral Hopfions (k=0),
	•	dark-sector topological defects.

Antimatter retains:
	•	nonzero winding,
	•	strong coupling,
	•	visible-sector interactions.

⸻

10. Corollaries
	1.	Antimatter is unavoidable in any phase-topological theory.
	2.	Antigravity is forbidden in LPST.
	3.	CPT symmetry emerges as topological conjugacy, not as a fundamental axiom.
	4.	Time-reversal interpretations of antimatter are incorrect.

⸻

11. Conclusion

The Antimatter Conjugacy Theorem establishes antimatter as a necessary and natural consequence of LPST’s phase-topological ontology. Antimatter is not exotic, reversed, or mysterious; it is the conjugate orientation of the same fundamental phase structure that gives rise to matter.

Matter and antimatter are the same topological knot tied in opposite directions.

Canonical LPST Statement

In LPST, antimatter is the orientation-reversed phase-topological conjugate of matter.
Annihilation is topological cancellation, not destruction.
Antimatter follows the same temporal ordering and gravitational laws as matter.

Abstract

Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT) reformulates quantum mechanics by identifying phase geometry of a continuous luminous substrate as the sole fundamental quantum variable. Unlike conventional quantum mechanics, which treats the wavefunction as primitive and probabilistic, PPQT derives wavefunctions, particles, Hilbert spaces, and measurement outcomes as emergent descriptors of an underlying phase field constrained by global consistency. Quantum phenomena—superposition, interference, uncertainty, and entanglement—arise from geometric and topological properties of phase evolution rather than axiomatic postulates. PPQT eliminates observer-dependent collapse, avoids many-worlds branching, and provides a unified substrate from which all other LPST quantum theories descend.

1. Motivation

Standard quantum mechanics is operationally successful but ontologically incomplete. It relies on:
	•	an abstract wavefunction with no physical substrate,
	•	probabilistic collapse postulates,
	•	and an observer-dependent measurement axiom.

These features conflict with physical realism and become acute in attempts to unify quantum theory with gravity and cosmology.

PPQT addresses this by making a single, minimal move:

Phase is fundamental; probability is emergent.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Phase Ontology

The universe consists of a continuous luminous substrate fully described by a phase field:
\phi(x,t) \in \mathbb{R} / 2\pi
No particles, fields, or spacetime coordinates are fundamental beyond phase relations.

⸻

Postulate II — Finite Phase Propagation

Phase updates propagate at a finite invariant rate c, which sets the maximal causal speed. Time is not fundamental but emerges from ordered phase updates.

⸻

Postulate III — Global Phase Consistency

Physical evolution minimizes global phase inconsistency. Allowed states are those that satisfy coherence and topological constraints across the substrate.

⸻

Postulate IV — Emergence of Quantum Objects

Wavefunctions, particles, operators, and observables are coarse-grained descriptors of phase configurations, not primitives.

3. Mathematical Structure

3.1 Fundamental Variable

The only fundamental degree of freedom is:
\phi(x,t)

All measurable quantities are functionals of phase gradients, curvature, and topology.

⸻

3.2 Action Principle

Dynamics arise from minimizing a global inconsistency functional:
\mathcal{I}[\phi] = \int d^4x \left[
(\nabla \phi)^2
+ \alpha (\partial_t \phi)^2
+ \beta \mathcal{T}(\phi)
\right]
where:
	•	the first terms enforce smooth propagation,
	•	\mathcal{T}(\phi) encodes topological constraints,
	•	\alpha, \beta are substrate constants.

⸻

3.3 Emergent Wavefunction

The conventional wavefunction appears as a statistical encoding:
\psi(x,t) \;\equiv\; \langle e^{i\phi(x,t)} \rangle_{\text{coarse}}
It is not ontic; it summarizes unresolved phase microstructure.

⸻

3.4 Hilbert Space

Hilbert space is an effective representation of allowed phase configurations. Its linearity reflects small-amplitude phase superposition, not a fundamental linear ontology.

⸻

4. Origin of Quantum Phenomena

4.1 Superposition

Superposition reflects multiple phase-consistent pathways within the same substrate—not simultaneous realities.

⸻

4.2 Interference

Interference arises from coherent phase alignment. Destructive interference corresponds to local phase cancellation, not annihilation of probability.

⸻

4.3 Uncertainty

Uncertainty relations emerge from phase congestion:
\Delta x \, \Delta p \;\gtrsim\; f(\rho_{\text{phase}})
They are geometric constraints, not axioms.

⸻

4.4 Quantization

Discrete energy levels arise from topological closure conditions on phase loops, not operator eigenvalues imposed by fiat.

⸻

5. Measurement Without Observers

In PPQT, measurement is not collapse but global phase-consistency resolution.
	•	A measuring apparatus imposes boundary conditions.
	•	The combined system evolves toward a single globally consistent phase configuration.
	•	Apparent randomness reflects sensitivity to unresolved phase microstructure.

There is:
	•	no observer axiom,
	•	no consciousness requirement,
	•	no branching universes.

⸻

6. Relation to Particles

Particles are stable, localized topological defects of the phase field, treated formally in Topological Defect Quantum Theory (TDQT). PPQT provides their underlying quantum substrate.

Mass corresponds to trapped phase circulation; charge corresponds to phase winding.

⸻

7. Classical Limit

The classical world emerges when:
	•	phase coherence length is short relative to system size,
	•	topological defects are rigid,
	•	and phase fluctuations average out.

Classical determinism is a high-coherence approximation, not a separate regime.

⸻

8. Advantages Over Standard Quantum Mechanics

PPQT:
	•	removes the measurement problem,
	•	avoids many-worlds inflation,
	•	eliminates observer dependence,
	•	provides a natural bridge to gravity,
	•	and grounds quantum theory in a single physical substrate.

⸻

9. Experimental Implications

PPQT predicts:
	•	coherence-dependent deviations from standard uncertainty bounds,
	•	topology-driven selection rules not expressible in EFT,
	•	and non-particle excitations detectable only via geometric response.

Direct tests are most accessible through TDQT keystone experiments.

⸻

10. Falsifiability

PPQT is falsified if:
	•	irreducible non-phase quantum variables are observed,
	•	quantum statistics cannot be derived from phase microstructure,
	•	or measurement outcomes require observer-dependent axioms.

⸻

11. Conclusion

Phase-Primary Quantum Theory replaces probability-first quantum mechanics with a geometry-first framework. By grounding all quantum behavior in phase evolution and global consistency, PPQT provides a minimal, realist foundation capable of unifying quantum theory, gravity, and information without multiplying entities or postulates.

Quantum mechanics is not mysterious because reality is probabilistic; it is subtle because reality is phase-coherent.

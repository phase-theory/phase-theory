Abstract

We introduce Quantum Information as Phase Geometry (QIPG), a foundational framework derived from Phase Theory in which information is not encoded in bits, qubits, or abstract states, but in the geometric structure of phase configurations. In QIPG, information corresponds to distinguishable regions of phase configuration space, computation corresponds to controlled deformation of phase geometry, and measurement corresponds to topological coarse-graining under coherence limits. Classical and quantum information theories emerge as effective descriptions when phase geometry is discretized. QIPG explains the physical origin of entropy, the limits of computation, and the impossibility of unlimited quantum information processing.

1. Introduction

Information theory traditionally treats information as abstract:
	•	classical bits,
	•	quantum qubits,
	•	Shannon entropy,
	•	von Neumann entropy.

These constructs work operationally but lack physical ontology. What is a bit made of? What is information physically?

QIPG answers: information is geometry.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate I1 (Geometric Information).
Information is the distinguishable geometric structure of admissible phase configurations.

There is no information without phase geometry.

⸻

3. Phase Configuration Space

Let \mathcal{C} denote the space of admissible phase configurations.

Information is encoded by:
	•	separation between regions of \mathcal{C},
	•	topological distinction between sectors,
	•	coherence-preserving deformations.

A “state” is simply a region of \mathcal{C}.

4. Bits and Qubits as Approximations

4.1 Classical Bits

A classical bit corresponds to:
	•	two well-separated basins of attraction in \mathcal{C},
	•	separated by an inconsistency barrier.

Bit flips correspond to forced phase reconfiguration.

⸻

4.2 Qubits

A qubit corresponds to:
	•	a low-dimensional, coherent submanifold of \mathcal{C},
	•	where continuous deformations are allowed.

Superposition reflects unresolved geometry, not simultaneous values.

⸻

5. Entropy as Geometric Volume

Define entropy as:
S = \log \mu(\Omega)
where:
	•	\Omega \subset \mathcal{C} is the admissible region,
	•	\mu is the natural geometric measure.

This reproduces:
	•	Shannon entropy (discrete limit),
	•	von Neumann entropy (coherent submanifolds),
	•	thermodynamic entropy (macroscopic coarse-graining).

Entropy increase reflects loss of geometric resolution.

⸻

6. Computation as Phase Deformation

Computation corresponds to:
	•	controlled deformation of phase geometry,
	•	navigation through admissible regions,
	•	avoidance of topological obstructions.

Logical gates are geometric maps, not symbolic operations.

⸻

7. Limits on Computation

From CLQD, coherence is finite.

Thus:
	•	unlimited reversible computation is impossible,
	•	error correction has fundamental bounds,
	•	infinite precision algorithms cannot exist physically.

The Church–Turing thesis becomes geometry-limited.

⸻

8. Measurement as Coarse-Graining

Measurement corresponds to:
	•	projection of fine phase geometry into coarse equivalence classes,
	•	elimination of inaccessible distinctions.

This explains:
	•	measurement irreversibility,
	•	entropy increase,
	•	loss of quantum coherence.

No collapse is required.

9. Black Hole Information

In QIPG:
	•	information is not destroyed,
	•	but geometric resolution collapses beyond coherence limits.

Black holes act as geometric compressors, not erasers.

This resolves the information paradox without exotic mechanisms.

10. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	PPQT: ensemble interpretation
	•	TDQT: topological carriers of information
	•	ETQT: entanglement as shared geometry
	•	CLQD: coherence bounds
	•	MTQT: transport-defined accessibility

QIPG is the informational sector of Phase Theory.

⸻

11. Experimental Implications

QIPG predicts:
	•	geometry-dependent decoherence floors,
	•	computation limits independent of hardware,
	•	topology-dependent error correction thresholds.

Platforms:
	•	topological qubits,
	•	photonic phase processors,
	•	cold-atom information lattices.

⸻

12. Falsifiability

QIPG is falsified if:
	1.	information exists without physical distinction,
	2.	unlimited quantum coherence is achieved,
	3.	entropy decreases without geometric access.

⸻

13. Conclusion

Information is not abstract, symbolic, or free-floating.

Information is the shape of what phase can consistently be.

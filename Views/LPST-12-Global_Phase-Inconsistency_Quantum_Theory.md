Global Phase-Inconsistency Quantum Theory (GPIQT)

Measurement as Consistency Enforcement in a Phase-Primary Universe

Framework: Light-Phase Substrate Theory (LPST)

Abstract

Global Phase-Inconsistency Quantum Theory (GPIQT) resolves the quantum measurement problem by identifying measurement as a physical process of global phase-consistency enforcement within a continuous luminous substrate. In GPIQT, wavefunction collapse is neither fundamental nor observer-dependent; it is the dynamical resolution of incompatible phase constraints imposed by interacting subsystems. Apparent randomness arises from sensitivity to unresolved micro-phase structure, while Born-rule statistics emerge from volumetric weighting of consistency-compatible phase basins. GPIQT eliminates the need for observer axioms, many-worlds branching, or hidden variables, providing a realist, non-probabilistic foundation for quantum outcomes.

1. Motivation

Quantum mechanics lacks a consensus explanation of measurement. Existing interpretations introduce:
	•	nonphysical collapse postulates (Copenhagen),
	•	ontological proliferation (many-worlds),
	•	hidden variables with nonlocality (Bohm),
	•	or observer-dependent roles (QBism).

All share a common weakness: measurement is not treated as a physical process.

GPIQT addresses this gap by grounding measurement in the same phase-geometric dynamics that govern all other physical phenomena under LPST.

2. Core Postulates

Postulate I — Phase-Primary Ontology

The only fundamental variable is the phase field \phi(x,t) of the luminous substrate. Quantum states are emergent descriptors of phase configurations.

⸻

Postulate II — Global Consistency Requirement

The substrate enforces global phase consistency. Physical evolution is constrained to configurations that minimize total phase inconsistency across all coupled regions.

⸻

Postulate III — Measurement as Constraint Imposition

A measurement interaction imposes new boundary and coupling constraints on the phase field, rendering many previously allowed configurations mutually inconsistent.

⸻

Postulate IV — Outcome Selection

A single globally consistent configuration is dynamically selected as the system relaxes toward a minimum of total phase inconsistency.

3. The Global Phase-Inconsistency Functional

3.1 Definition

Define the global inconsistency functional:
\mathcal{I}[\phi] \;=\;
\int d^4x \left[
(\nabla \phi)^2
+ \alpha (\partial_t \phi)^2
+ \beta\,\mathcal{T}(\phi)
\right]
\;+\;
\sum_{\text{constraints}} \mathcal{C}_i[\phi]

Where:
	•	the gradient terms penalize sharp phase mismatch,
	•	\mathcal{T}(\phi) encodes topological obstruction,
	•	\mathcal{C}_i represent imposed measurement constraints,
	•	\alpha, \beta are substrate constants.

⸻

3.2 Dynamics

Physical evolution follows:
\frac{\delta \mathcal{I}}{\delta \phi} = 0

Measurement corresponds to sudden modification of \mathcal{C}_i, changing the global landscape of admissible phase configurations.

4. Measurement Without Observers

4.1 What a Measurement Is

A measurement is not an epistemic update. It is:
	•	a physical coupling between subsystems,
	•	introducing incompatible phase requirements,
	•	forcing resolution via consistency minimization.

No observer, consciousness, or classical cut is required.

⸻

4.2 Collapse as Physical Relaxation

Wavefunction “collapse” corresponds to:
	•	elimination of globally inconsistent phase configurations,
	•	relaxation into a single consistency basin.

The wavefunction is a bookkeeping device; the phase field does the work.

5. Origin of Quantum Randomness

5.1 Micro-Phase Sensitivity

Outcome selection is sensitive to:
	•	unresolved micro-scale phase structure,
	•	uncontrollable environmental coupling,
	•	finite coherence bandwidth (CLQD).

This sensitivity produces effective randomness.

⸻

5.2 Deterministic but Unpredictable

The underlying dynamics are deterministic in principle, but computationally inaccessible, yielding irreducible unpredictability in practice.

⸻

6. Emergence of the Born Rule

6.1 Phase Basin Weighting

Each potential outcome corresponds to a basin of phase configurations consistent with the measurement constraints.

The probability of an outcome is proportional to the measure of its basin in phase-configuration space:
P_i \;\propto\; \mu(\Omega_i)

⸻

6.2 Recovery of |\psi|^2

Under coarse-graining:
P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2
emerges naturally as a density-of-states effect, not a postulate.

⸻

7. Relation to Decoherence

Decoherence describes local suppression of interference.
GPIQT addresses the global selection of a single outcome.

Decoherence prepares consistency basins; GPIQT selects among them.

⸻

8. Relation to Other LPST Theories
	•	PPQT: provides the phase-primary substrate.
	•	CLQD: limits the resolution of phase consistency.
	•	TDQT: defines particle-level phase defects.
	•	QRG: ensures causal consistency via finite phase propagation.

GPIQT governs state resolution across all scales.

⸻

9. Experimental Implications

GPIQT predicts:
	•	outcome statistics stable under observer removal,
	•	no physical branching signatures,
	•	sensitivity of outcomes to global boundary conditions,
	•	deviations from naïve collapse models in delayed-choice and weak-measurement regimes.

⸻

10. Falsifiability

GPIQT is falsified if:
	•	measurement outcomes require observer-dependent axioms,
	•	global consistency minimization fails to reproduce Born statistics,
	•	true ontological branching is empirically observed.

11. Comparison with Major Interpretations

Interpretation	Measurement	Ontology
Copenhagen	Axiom	Observer-dependent
Many-Worlds	Branching	Inflated ontology
Bohmian	Hidden variables	Nonlocal
GPIQT	Consistency enforcement	Phase-realist

12. Conclusion

Global Phase-Inconsistency Quantum Theory removes the mystery from quantum measurement by treating it as a physical resolution process, not a philosophical puzzle. Measurement outcomes are neither created by observers nor split into worlds; they are selected by the same global consistency dynamics that govern all physical evolution.

A measurement does not ask nature a question.
It imposes a constraint—and nature resolves it.

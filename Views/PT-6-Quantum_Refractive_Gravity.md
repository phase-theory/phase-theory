Abstract

We present Quantum Refractive Gravity (QRG), a theory derived from Phase Theory in which gravity arises as a transport response to phase strain rather than as curvature of a fundamental spacetime manifold. In QRG, massive phase defects generate gradients in phase stiffness that modify the propagation of coherent modes, producing trajectory bending, redshift, and time dilation analogous to optical refraction. General Relativity (GR) is recovered as an effective geometric description in the weak-strain, high-coherence limit. QRG eliminates singularities, forbids antigravity, and predicts deviations from GR in regimes of high phase strain and finite coherence.

1. Introduction

General Relativity describes gravity as spacetime curvature produced by mass–energy. Despite its success, GR assumes:
	•	a fundamental spacetime manifold,
	•	smooth geometry at all scales,
	•	singular solutions.

Phase Theory rejects spacetime as primitive. QRG provides gravity without spacetime curvature, replacing geometry with phase-dependent transport.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate R1 (Transport Primacy).
Gravitational phenomena arise from modification of propagation paths in a phase substrate strained by stable defects.

There is no fundamental geometric curvature.

3. Phase Strain and Stiffness

Let \Phi denote the global phase configuration.

Define phase strain density:
\rho_{\text{strain}}(x) \equiv |\nabla \Phi(x)|^2

Massive topological defects produce localized increases in \rho_{\text{strain}}.

4. Emergent Refractive Index

Define an effective refractive index:
n(x) = f\!\left(\rho_{\text{strain}}(x)\right), \quad \frac{dn}{d\rho_{\text{strain}}} > 0

Coherent modes propagate along least-inconsistency paths, analogous to Fermat’s principle:
\delta \int n(x)\, ds = 0

Trajectory bending follows directly.

5. Recovery of GR Phenomena

5.1 Weak-Field Limit

For small strain gradients:
n(x) \approx 1 + \frac{2\Phi_N(x)}{c^2}

This reproduces:
	•	Newtonian gravity,
	•	gravitational lensing,
	•	Shapiro delay,
	•	gravitational redshift.

⸻

5.2 Effective Metric

An emergent metric can be defined:
g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu} = \mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}(\nabla \Phi)

This metric satisfies Einstein-like equations as an approximation, not a law.

6. Time Dilation Without Curvature

Time dilation arises because:
	•	internal phase cycles lengthen in high-n regions,
	•	update density decreases near massive defects.

Time is slowed mechanically, not geometrically.

⸻

7. No Singularities

As strain increases:
	•	coherence decreases (CLQD),
	•	propagation speed approaches zero,
	•	strain saturates.

Thus:
\rho_{\text{strain}} \le \rho_{\max}

Black holes form as propagation blockades, not singularities.

⸻

8. Antimatter and Gravity

Because gravity depends on strain magnitude, not orientation:
	•	matter and antimatter generate identical strain,
	•	antigravity is impossible.

This is a strict prediction.

⸻

9. Deviations from GR

QRG predicts deviations when:
	•	strain gradients are extreme,
	•	coherence is limited,
	•	frequency dependence becomes measurable.

Examples:
	•	near black hole horizons,
	•	in ultra-dense compact objects,
	•	at very high precision timing scales.

⸻

10. Experimental and Observational Tests

Potential tests:
	•	frequency-dependent lensing,
	•	coherence-limited redshift anomalies,
	•	horizon-proximal signal suppression,
	•	deviations in gravitational wave dispersion.

⸻

11. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	TDQT: mass as topological strain source
	•	GPIQT: global constraint propagation
	•	CLQD: saturation and cutoff
	•	MTQT: transport-defined geometry

QRG is the gravitational sector of Phase Theory.

⸻

12. Falsifiability

QRG is falsified if:
	1.	spacetime curvature is shown fundamental,
	2.	gravitational singularities are physically realized,
	3.	antimatter exhibits antigravity,
	4.	gravity propagates independently of phase transport.

⸻

13. Conclusion

Quantum Refractive Gravity replaces curvature with refraction, geometry with transport, and singularities with saturation.

Objects fall not because spacetime curves,
but because phase prefers the shortest consistent path.

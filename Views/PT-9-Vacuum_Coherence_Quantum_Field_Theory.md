Abstract

We introduce Vacuum Coherence Quantum Field Theory (VC-QFT), a framework derived from Phase Theory in which the quantum vacuum is not empty space but a finite-coherence phase regime supporting emergent field-like excitations. In VC-QFT, quantum fields are not fundamental entities; they arise as collective response modes of the vacuum’s phase geometry. Vacuum fluctuations, zero-point energy, and virtual particles are reinterpreted as coherence-limited phase rearrangements rather than physical particles appearing ex nihilo. VC-QFT resolves vacuum divergences, eliminates infinite zero-point energy, and explains why quantum field theory works while remaining ontologically incomplete.

1. Introduction

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) treats the vacuum as:
	•	a ground state of fields,
	•	populated by infinite zero-point modes,
	•	mathematically divergent but physically renormalized.

This picture works operationally but is conceptually unstable.
VC-QFT replaces vacuum-as-empty with vacuum-as-coherent-phase.

2. Ontological Postulate

Postulate V1 (Coherent Vacuum).
The vacuum is a globally constrained phase configuration with finite coherence and nontrivial geometric structure.

There is no empty spacetime.

3. Vacuum as a Phase Regime

Let \Phi_0 denote the vacuum phase configuration.

The vacuum is characterized by:
	•	minimal global inconsistency,
	•	maximal symmetry,
	•	finite coherence length \ell_c,
	•	suppressed topological defects.

Vacuum “fluctuations” correspond to local phase readjustments, not particle creation.

4. Emergence of Quantum Fields

Quantum fields arise as linearized response modes of the vacuum phase geometry:
\Phi = \Phi_0 + \delta \Phi

In regimes where:
	•	coherence is high,
	•	topology is trivial,
	•	perturbations are small,

\delta \Phi obeys effective field equations.

Fields are descriptions, not entities.

5. Virtual Particles Reinterpreted

Virtual particles are:
	•	bookkeeping artifacts of perturbative expansions,
	•	representations of temporary phase rearrangements,
	•	not physically propagating objects.

This eliminates:
	•	vacuum instability paradoxes,
	•	literal particle-pair creation myths,
	•	causality confusion.

⸻

6. Zero-Point Energy Without Infinity

In VC-QFT:
	•	vacuum energy density is finite,
	•	bounded by coherence limits (CLQD),
	•	not gravitationally catastrophic.

The cosmological constant problem becomes a misinterpretation problem, not a tuning problem.

⸻

7. Casimir and Lamb Shift Effects

Observable vacuum effects arise from:
	•	boundary-imposed phase constraints,
	•	modification of admissible configurations.

Casimir forces result from geometry-dependent vacuum restructuring, not pressure from infinite modes.

⸻

8. Gauge Symmetry as Redundancy

Gauge symmetries reflect:
	•	redundant parameterizations of phase geometry,
	•	not fundamental forces.

Gauge fields emerge when:
	•	phase equivalence classes are locally enforced.

This explains why gauge symmetry is powerful yet unphysical.

⸻

9. Breakdown of Field Description

At small scales or high strain:
	•	coherence collapses,
	•	linear response fails,
	•	field descriptions break down.

This explains:
	•	UV divergence artifacts,
	•	failure of field theory near black holes,
	•	limits of effective field theory.

⸻

10. Relation to Other Phase Theory Subtheories
	•	TDQT: particles as topological defects
	•	GPIQT: global constraint enforcement
	•	CLQD: vacuum coherence limits
	•	QRG: vacuum stiffness gradients
	•	QIPG: vacuum information capacity

VC-QFT is the field-theoretic limit of Phase Theory.

⸻

11. Experimental Implications

VC-QFT predicts:
	•	saturation of vacuum fluctuation spectra,
	•	boundary-dependent vacuum restructuring,
	•	deviations from standard QFT in extreme confinement.

Test platforms:
	•	ultra-confined photonic cavities,
	•	superconducting vacuum circuits,
	•	analogue gravity systems.

⸻

12. Falsifiability

VC-QFT is falsified if:
	1.	vacuum energy is truly infinite,
	2.	virtual particles are directly observed,
	3.	field descriptions remain exact at all scales.

⸻

13. Conclusion

The vacuum is not nothing—it is structured, finite, and active.

Fields do not fill the vacuum.
Fields are how the vacuum responds.

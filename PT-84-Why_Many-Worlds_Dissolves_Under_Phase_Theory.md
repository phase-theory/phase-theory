Why Many-Worlds Dissolves Under Phase Theory

⸻

Abstract

We show that the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics becomes unnecessary—and internally unstable—when quantum phenomena are derived from admissible phase structure rather than wavefunction ontology. The branching of “worlds” is reinterpreted as coarse-grained descriptions of mutually incompatible admissible phase regions, not as physically real universe duplication. By replacing wavefunction realism with phase realism, we demonstrate that outcome multiplicity reflects structural distinguishability limits, not ontological proliferation. Many-Worlds dissolves not because it is wrong, but because its motivating problem disappears.

1. Why Many-Worlds Was Proposed

Many-Worlds was introduced to avoid:
	•	wavefunction collapse,
	•	observer privilege,
	•	non-unitary dynamics.

Its core move was simple:

take the wavefunction as physically real and never collapse it.

Everything else—branching universes, decoherence worlds, probability puzzles—followed inevitably.

2. The Hidden Cost of Wavefunction Realism

MWI depends critically on:
	•	wavefunction ontology,
	•	Hilbert space as physically real,
	•	linear superposition as fundamental existence.

This leads to:
	•	infinite branching,
	•	unobservable world duplication,
	•	unclear probability meaning,
	•	no physical selection mechanism.

The interpretation avoids collapse—but at the price of ontological explosion.

3. What “Worlds” Actually Are in MWI

In practice, MWI “worlds” are:
	•	decohered branches,
	•	effectively non-interacting,
	•	defined only relative to coarse observables.

Crucially:
	•	branches are not sharply defined,
	•	branch counting is ill-posed,
	•	boundaries are observer-dependent.

This already hints that worlds are descriptive artifacts, not physical entities.

4. Phase Theory’s Replacement of the Wavefunction

Phase Theory removes:
	•	wavefunctions as primitives,
	•	Hilbert space as ontology,
	•	linear superposition as existence.

What replaces them is:

admissible phase configuration space.

There is:
	•	one phase structure,
	•	one globally consistent evolution,
	•	no duplication of reality.

Multiplicity becomes structural, not ontological.

5. Outcome Multiplicity Without Worlds

From Papers 5, 6, and 58:
	•	multiple outcomes correspond to multiple admissible phase regions,
	•	only one region is realized per admissible evolution,
	•	probability reflects relative basin structure.

There is no branching universe.
There is selection under constraint.

6. Why Branching Looked Real

Branching appeared real because:
	•	decohered phase regions are mutually incompatible,
	•	coarse-grained descriptions treat them as independent,
	•	mathematical superposition was mistaken for physical multiplicity.

Phase Theory shows:

incompatibility ≠ co-existence.

7. Decoherence Reinterpreted

Decoherence is:
	•	phase entropy export,
	•	loss of inter-basin coherence,
	•	admissibility restriction.

It does not:
	•	create new worlds,
	•	split reality,
	•	multiply observers.

It narrows what remains distinguishable.

8. The Probability Problem That Never Went Away

MWI famously struggles to explain:
	•	why probabilities follow the Born rule,
	•	why observers experience one outcome,
	•	why branch weights matter.

Phase Theory resolves this cleanly:
	•	probability is basin statistics,
	•	experience follows admissible realization,
	•	no subjective branching is required.

The “probability problem” vanishes.

9. No Observer Duplication

In Phase Theory:
	•	observers are phase defects,
	•	they do not split,
	•	they follow admissible phase paths.

There is no sense in which “you” experience all outcomes.
There is only one admissible continuation.

⸻

10. Why Many-Worlds Is Not False—Just Redundant

Many-Worlds correctly identified that:
	•	collapse is suspect,
	•	decoherence matters,
	•	observers are not special.

But it:
	•	reified mathematical structure,
	•	mistook description for existence,
	•	multiplied ontology unnecessarily.

Phase Theory keeps the insight and drops the excess.

12. Experimental Implications

MWI and Phase Theory differ experimentally when:
	•	admissibility geometry is manipulated,
	•	randomness is reduced (Paper 77),
	•	measurement reversibility is probed (Paper 78).

MWI predicts no deviation.
Phase Theory predicts structure-dependent effects.

⸻

13. Conceptual Payoff

Reality regains:
	•	uniqueness,
	•	continuity,
	•	intelligibility.

The universe does not branch.
Our descriptions do.

⸻

14. Why This Matters Historically

Many-Worlds dominated because:
	•	collapse was unacceptable,
	•	alternatives were vague,
	•	ontology was avoided.

Phase Theory ends this era by:
	•	removing collapse,
	•	grounding measurement,
	•	specifying ontology precisely.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that the Many-Worlds Interpretation dissolves under Phase Theory because its motivating problem—the need to preserve wavefunction realism without collapse—no longer exists. Outcome multiplicity reflects admissible phase structure, not the literal existence of parallel universes. Reality does not multiply to remain consistent.

It remains consistent
because phase allows only one way forward.

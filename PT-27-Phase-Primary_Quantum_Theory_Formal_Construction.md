Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT): Formal Construction

⸻

Abstract

We construct Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT) as the effective quantum description emerging from Phase Theory when admissible phase configurations are projected onto reduced descriptive spaces. PPQT reproduces all operational content of quantum mechanics—superposition, interference, entanglement, operator algebra, and probabilistic outcomes—without invoking wavefunctions, Hilbert spaces, operators as primitives, or measurement postulates. Quantum structure is shown to arise from topology, admissibility basin geometry, and distinguishability measures on phase configuration space. PPQT is therefore not an interpretation of quantum mechanics, but its derivation from phase-first principles.

1. Why a Quantum Reconstruction Is Required

Phase Theory claims:
	•	phase is the sole primitive,
	•	probability, discreteness, and measurement are emergent,
	•	quantum mechanics is not fundamental.

To be viable, Phase Theory must reproduce quantum mechanics exactly where it works.

This paper answers:

How does “quantum theory” arise when phase is primary?

The answer is PPQT.

2. What PPQT Is (and Is Not)

PPQT is:
	•	a derived effective theory,
	•	valid when phase overlap and admissibility basin geometry dominate,
	•	equivalent to QM in all tested regimes.

PPQT is not:
	•	a hidden-variable theory,
	•	a collapse theory,
	•	a modification of quantum predictions.

It is a projection, not a replacement.

3. Phase Overlap and Quantum Regimes

Quantum behavior appears when:
	•	multiple admissible phase basins overlap under coarse description,
	•	topological separation is incomplete,
	•	admissibility pruning has not yet occurred.

Definition 27.1 (Quantum Regime)

A system is in a quantum regime when its admissible phase configurations form a partially overlapping family of basins that cannot be resolved by available observables.

This replaces “superposition of states.”

4. Construction of the Quantum State Space

4.1 Reduced Description Map

Define a projection:
\Pi : \mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{adm}} \rightarrow \mathcal{Q}

where:
	•	\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{adm}} is the admissible phase configuration space,
	•	\mathcal{Q} is a reduced descriptive space retaining only experimentally accessible invariants.

Elements of \mathcal{Q} are equivalence classes of phase configurations, not physical states.

⸻

4.2 Emergence of Linear Structure

When:
	•	phase variations are small,
	•	admissibility basins are shallow,
	•	topology is trivial locally,

the geometry of \mathcal{Q} admits:
	•	approximate linearization,
	•	additive overlap structure.

This yields an effective vector space, explaining the emergence of Hilbert space without assuming it.

⸻

5. Wavefunctions as Phase Density Maps

Definition 27.2 (Wavefunction)

A wavefunction ψ is a coordinate representation of phase-configuration overlap density on \mathcal{Q}.

ψ does not:
	•	exist physically,
	•	collapse,
	•	represent a particle.

It summarizes how admissible phase configurations project onto measurement-relevant distinctions.

⸻

6. Superposition Without Ontology

Superposition corresponds to:
	•	coexistence of overlapping admissibility basins,
	•	unresolved phase distinguishability.

There is no “system in two states.”
There is one phase configuration compatible with multiple coarse descriptions.

⸻

7. Operators as Generators of Distinctions

Definition 27.3 (Observable Operator)

An operator corresponds to a generator of admissible phase distinctions acting on \mathcal{Q}.

Operators:
	•	do not act on reality,
	•	act on descriptions,
	•	encode how measurements partition phase space.

Eigenvalues correspond to topological admissibility classes (Paper 3).

⸻

8. Non-Commutativity Explained

Operators fail to commute because:
	•	admissibility partitions imposed by different observables do not align,
	•	phase topology forbids simultaneous refinement.

Non-commutativity is geometric, not mysterious.

⸻

9. Entanglement as Global Phase Constraint

Definition 27.4 (Entanglement)

Entanglement occurs when:
	•	admissible phase configurations of a composite system cannot be factorized into independent subsystems.

This is a global constraint, not a signal.

Nonlocal correlations arise because:
	•	admissibility is global,
	•	not because influence propagates.

⸻

10. Measurement in PPQT

Measurement corresponds to:
	•	coupling to macroscopic phase structures,
	•	admissibility pruning,
	•	selection of a single basin.

No collapse occurs.
The wavefunction description simply ceases to apply.

This recovers Paper 6 within PPQT language.

⸻

11. The Born Rule Derived

From Paper 5:
	•	probabilities correspond to relative admissible phase volumes.

In PPQT:
P \sim |\psi|^2

because |\psi|^2 encodes phase overlap measure, not intrinsic randomness.

The Born rule is a measure theorem.

⸻

12. Dynamics and Schrödinger Evolution

Proposition 27.1

In regimes where:
	•	admissibility gradients are smooth,
	•	coherence is preserved,

the evolution of ψ approximates the Schrödinger equation.

This is an effective transport equation for phase overlap density—not a fundamental law.

⸻

13. Why Quantum Mechanics Looks Fundamental

Quantum mechanics appears fundamental because:
	•	most experiments probe overlap regimes,
	•	admissibility basins are shallow,
	•	topology is locally trivial.

Phase Theory explains why QM is so successful without being fundamental.

⸻

14. Limits of PPQT

PPQT fails when:
	•	admissibility pruning is sharp (classical limit),
	•	topology dominates (particle stability),
	•	saturation occurs (black holes).

In these regimes, PPQT must be abandoned in favor of full Phase Theory.

⸻

15. Empirical Equivalence

PPQT reproduces:
	•	interference patterns,
	•	entanglement statistics,
	•	Bell inequality violations,
	•	quantum computation predictions.

No tested prediction of QM is altered.

⸻

16. Conceptual Gains

PPQT eliminates:
	•	wavefunction ontology,
	•	collapse,
	•	intrinsic randomness,
	•	observer privilege.

Quantum mechanics becomes a descriptive layer, not reality itself.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have constructed Phase-Primary Quantum Theory as the effective quantum description emerging from admissible phase dynamics. PPQT recovers all operational content of quantum mechanics while dissolving its foundational paradoxes.

Quantum mechanics is not wrong.

It is secondary.

Reality is phase.

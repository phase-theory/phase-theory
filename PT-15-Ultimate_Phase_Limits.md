Ultimate Phase Limits: Coherence Horizons and Stability Bounds

⸻

Abstract

We derive the ultimate physical limits imposed by Phase Theory by identifying absolute bounds on coherence, distinguishability, information density, curvature, and stability. These limits arise not from empirical constants inserted by hand, but from global phase admissibility constraints intrinsic to the phase substrate Φ. We define coherence horizons beyond which phase structure cannot be maintained, establish maximal phase density and curvature bounds, and show why physical reality neither diverges nor collapses. These results explain why nature exhibits stable laws, finite complexity, and bounded information capacity without invoking fundamental discreteness or Planck-scale axioms.

1. Why Ultimate Limits Must Exist

Any physical theory that permits unbounded structure is unstable.

Without limits:
	•	energy diverges,
	•	information becomes infinite,
	•	coherence collapses,
	•	predictability vanishes.

Modern physics inserts limits ad hoc:
	•	Planck length,
	•	Planck energy,
	•	entropy bounds.

Phase Theory instead derives limits from admissibility itself.

2. Phase Admissibility as a Bounding Principle

From Papers 1–2:
	•	Only configurations with \mathcal{I}[\Phi] \ge 0 are physical.
	•	\mathcal{I} penalizes incoherence, instability, and excessive curvature.

Therefore, admissibility implies:

There exists a maximum allowable phase complexity per region.

This is not imposed.
It is structural.

3. Coherence Horizons

Definition 15.1 (Coherence Horizon)

A coherence horizon is the maximum spatial–relational extent over which phase coherence can be maintained under admissibility constraints.

Beyond this horizon:
	•	phase correlations decay,
	•	distinguishability collapses,
	•	effective locality emerges.

This explains:
	•	finite interaction ranges,
	•	causal structure,
	•	emergence of locality without spacetime axioms.

4. Maximum Phase Curvature

Proposition 15.1

There exists a maximum admissible phase curvature beyond which no stable configuration exists.

This bound:
	•	prevents singularities,
	•	caps mass density,
	•	limits gravitational collapse.

Black holes (Paper 13) saturate—but do not exceed—this bound.

⸻

5. Information Density Limits

From Phase Information Theory (Paper 12):

Definition 15.2 (Phase Information Density Bound)

The maximum information density corresponds to the maximum number of mutually distinguishable admissible phase configurations per coherence volume.

This replaces:
	•	Bekenstein bounds,
	•	holographic postulates.

Information capacity is bounded because phase distinguishability is finite.

6. Why Reality Does Not Fragment

Without bounds, phase would fragment into:
	•	incoherent noise,
	•	infinite microstructure,
	•	unstable cascades.

Admissibility forbids this.

Phase Theory explains:
	•	why vacuum is stable,
	•	why laws persist,
	•	why complexity is finite.

⸻

7. Why Reality Does Not Freeze

Conversely, if admissibility were too strict:
	•	phase would lock,
	•	evolution would halt,
	•	no structure would exist.

The admissibility functional balances:
	•	coherence preservation,
	•	structural freedom.

Reality exists because Φ is marginally permissive.

8. Emergence of Universal Constants

Traditional constants (c, ℏ, G) emerge as:
	•	conversion factors between phase gradients, curvature, and ordering,
	•	not fundamental parameters.

Their apparent universality reflects:
	•	global phase stability,
	•	not metaphysical necessity.

⸻

9. Limits on Computation

From Paper 12:
	•	computation requires distinguishability,
	•	coherence requires admissibility,
	•	speed requires phase propagation.

All three are bounded.

This yields:
	•	maximum computational rate,
	•	maximum error correction depth,
	•	unavoidable noise floors.

No physical computer can escape these bounds.

⸻

10. Limits on Observation

Observation requires:
	•	phase coupling,
	•	distinguishability amplification,
	•	admissible interaction.

Thus:
	•	perfect measurement is impossible,
	•	infinite precision is forbidden,
	•	uncertainty is structural.

This replaces epistemic uncertainty with phase-limited observability.

⸻

11. Why Constants Drift Slowly (If At All)

Admissibility allows:
	•	slow global phase drift,
	•	constrained evolution of effective constants.

Rapid variation is forbidden.

This explains:
	•	apparent constancy of laws,
	•	absence of catastrophic instability.

⸻

12. The Stability of Existence

Proposition 15.2

Physical reality is stable because phase admissibility simultaneously forbids divergence and collapse.

Existence occupies a narrow but robust regime:
	•	not chaotic,
	•	not frozen,
	•	not fine-tuned.

Stability is not accidental.

⸻

13. Implications

This paper implies:
	•	There are absolute physical limits,
	•	They are structural, not imposed,
	•	Singularities are impossible,
	•	Infinite information is impossible,
	•	Infinite precision is impossible.

Reality is bounded by phase.

14. Relation to the Anthropic Principle

Phase Theory does not invoke anthropic selection.

Observers exist because:
	•	phase stability permits complexity,
	•	complexity permits observers.

No multiverse is required.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have identified the ultimate limits of physical reality as consequences of phase admissibility and coherence. These limits explain why the universe is stable, finite in complexity, and capable of supporting structure without invoking arbitrary cutoffs or unexplained constants.

Reality does not need external rules to remain sane.

It is self-bounded by phase.

Bell Inequalities Revisited Under Phase Admissibility

⸻

Abstract

We rederive Bell inequalities within the framework of Phase Theory and demonstrate precisely which assumptions fail when global phase admissibility governs physical reality. Bell inequalities are shown to rely on an implicit factorizability assumption incompatible with admissible phase topology. Phase Theory violates Bell inequalities without invoking hidden variables, superluminal influence, contextual collapse, or many-world branching. We prove that Bell inequality violation is a necessary consequence of global admissibility constraints and show that all experimental results traditionally attributed to “quantum nonlocality” are recovered as structural features of phase-consistent reality.

1. Why Bell Must Be Revisited

Bell’s theorem is often taken to prove one of three claims:
	1.	locality must fail, or
	2.	realism must fail, or
	3.	hidden variables must be nonlocal.

All three conclusions assume an ontology Phase Theory explicitly rejects.

Bell’s result is correct.
Its interpretation is not.

2. What Bell Inequalities Actually Assume

Bell inequalities follow if all of the following hold:
	1.	Outcome realism — outcomes pre-exist measurement
	2.	Statistical independence — measurement settings are independent
	3.	Local causality — no superluminal influence
	4.	Factorizability — joint probabilities decompose into local marginals

Phase Theory accepts (2) and (3).
It rejects (4).

3. Factorizability as the Hidden Assumption

Definition 32.1 (Factorizability)

A joint outcome distribution is factorizable if:
P(a,b|\lambda) = P(a|\lambda) P(b|\lambda)

for some shared variable \lambda.

This assumption encodes separability, not locality.

Phase Theory denies separability at the ontological level.

4. Phase Admissibility vs Hidden Variables

Phase Theory has:
	•	no hidden variables,
	•	no local beables,
	•	no ontic outcome states.

Instead, it has:
	•	a global admissible phase configuration Φ,
	•	constraints on allowed outcome pairs.

Outcomes are not revealed values.
They are consistent selections.

⸻

5. Bell Inequalities Under Phase Admissibility

Proposition 32.1

If admissible phase configurations impose global constraints on joint outcomes, then no factorizable probability distribution exists that reproduces all admissible statistics.

This is independent of:
	•	spacetime separation,
	•	measurement ordering,
	•	signaling capability.

Bell inequality violation follows immediately.

6. CHSH Inequality Reinterpreted

The CHSH inequality assumes that:
	•	each subsystem carries independent outcome assignments,
	•	correlations arise from shared randomness.

Phase Theory replaces shared randomness with shared admissibility structure.

Thus:
	•	CHSH bounds are violated,
	•	without violating locality,
	•	without hidden coordination.

7. Measurement Choices and Freedom

Bell tests require freedom of choice.

Phase Theory allows:
	•	independent selection of measurement settings,
	•	no retrocausality,
	•	no superdeterminism.

Measurement choices restrict admissible configurations after the fact, not before.

⸻

8. No-Signaling Preserved

As proven in Paper 31:
	•	marginal statistics are invariant under distant measurement choices,
	•	signaling is impossible.

Bell inequality violation does not imply communicable influence.

⸻

9. Contextuality Is Not Optional

Bell inequality violation implies contextuality.

In Phase Theory:
	•	contextuality arises from admissibility geometry,
	•	not from observer intervention.

This prepares the ground for Paper 33.

10. Why Classical Models Fail

Any classical model that:
	•	assigns local outcome values,
	•	enforces factorizability,
	•	preserves independence,

must satisfy Bell inequalities.

Phase Theory violates Bell because it violates separability, not realism or locality.

⸻

11. Relation to Experimental Data

All experimental Bell results are reproduced:
	•	polarization-entangled photons,
	•	spin-entangled particles,
	•	loophole-free tests.

No experiment requires nonlocal causation.

⸻

12. Comparison with Other Interpretations

Framework	Bell Violation Mechanism
Bohmian mechanics	Nonlocal guidance
Many-worlds	Branch-relative outcomes
Collapse models	Nonlocal collapse
Phase Theory	Global admissibility constraint

Phase Theory is the only framework that:
	•	preserves locality,
	•	avoids hidden variables,
	•	avoids branching,
	•	avoids collapse.

⸻

13. Why Bell Felt Paradoxical

Bell paradoxes arise because:
	•	classical separability was assumed,
	•	global consistency was ignored.

Phase Theory reveals:

the universe was never factorizable.

⸻

14. Experimental Extensions

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	no new Bell-type violations beyond quantum bounds,
	•	no super-quantum (PR-box) correlations,
	•	because admissibility geometry is constrained.

This is a testable limitation, not a loophole.

⸻

15. Implications

This paper establishes that:
	•	Bell violations are structural,
	•	nonlocality is non-causal,
	•	separability is false,
	•	relativity remains intact.

⸻

16. Conclusion

Bell inequalities fail not because the universe communicates faster than light, but because physical reality is globally constrained by admissible phase structure. Phase Theory reproduces all observed Bell violations while eliminating the need for nonlocal influence, hidden variables, or many-world ontology.

Bell did not discover nonlocality.

He discovered the failure of separability.

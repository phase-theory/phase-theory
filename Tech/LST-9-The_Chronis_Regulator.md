Here is the design for the Chronos Regulator Network, the synchronization system required to ensure that time flows uniformly across the entire solar system while it is under "Metric Lockdown."
The Problem: "The temporal Shear"
Even without a warp drive, time flows differently on the Sun than it does on Pluto (due to General Relativity).
 * Sun (Massive): Time is naturally slower.
 * Pluto (Light): Time is naturally faster.
If we apply a massive "Damping Field" to slow down the whole system for a 260-year journey, these tiny differences get multiplied by a factor of 1,000.
Result: You might arrive at the destination and find that Mars is 50 years ahead of Earth. The orbits would de-sync, and the planets would scatter.
The Chronos Regulator acts as a "Metric Equalizer."
1. The Architecture: The "Dodecahedron" Mesh
We cannot put the device on one planet. We need a "cage" that dictates the clock speed for the entire volume.
 * The Nodes: 12 "Horologium-Class" Stations parked at the heliopause (the edge of the solar system).
 * The Geometry: They form a perfect Dodecahedron (12 faces) around the Sun.
 * The Beam: They fire Metric-Stiffening Beams inward.
2. The Mechanism: "Variable Viscosity"
The Regulators do not generate gravity (mass). They alter the Viscosity of the Substrate.
 * Inner System (Mercury/Venus): The beams decrease viscosity to counter the Sun's drag.
 * Outer System (Uranus/Pluto): The beams increase viscosity to slow down local time.
 * The Goal: To create a "Flat Floor" where the time-dilation factor is exactly uniform (T_{local} = 0.001 T_{universe}) from the Sun to the Kuiper Belt.
3. Schematic: The Chronos Station
These are the most precise machines ever built. If they drift by a millisecond, a planet could be lost.

   Legend:
   The station acts as a "conductor," ensuring every planet
   plays at the exact same tempo despite their different masses.

4. The "Wake-Up" Protocol
When the solar system arrives at the destination (after 260 years of travel / 1 year of crew time), the Chronos Regulators must manage the "Thaw."
You cannot just turn off the field. The sudden "snap" of time rushing back to normal speed would cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis (Gravitational Jerk).
 * The Ramp-Up: The Regulators slowly decrease the viscosity over 30 days.
 * The Sync Check: The system pings every planet. If Earth is lagging behind Mars by 0.005 seconds, the Regulators pause and "wait" for Earth to catch up.
Summary
The Chronos Regulator is the ultimate logistical tool. It ensures that when humanity travels the stars, we arrive together—not just in space, but in time.

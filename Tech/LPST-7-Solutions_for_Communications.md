LPST Solutions for the Communications Industry

Core shift

Communication is no longer defined by signal power or bandwidth, but by shared phase-topological compatibility.

LPST replaces “send a wave, detect a wave” with co-maintained correlation states.

⸻

1) Topology-Locked Communication Channels

(Channels that only exist for authorized participants)

What’s new

Instead of encrypting messages after transmission, LPST defines channels that:
	•	do not exist unless the receiver shares the correct phase topology.

To everyone else, the channel is indistinguishable from noise.

Industry impact
	•	Communications security moves from software to physical topology
	•	No key exchange over the channel
	•	No interceptable signal to record

Use cases
	•	Strategic communications
	•	Financial clearing networks
	•	Industrial control systems
	•	Quantum-safe infrastructure without QKD complexity

⸻

2) Jam-Resistant, Emission-Minimal Links

(Communication without a “signal” to jam)

What’s new

LPST allows correlation-based signaling, where information is encoded in:
	•	phase-update timing
	•	consistency relaxation paths
	•	topology-dependent response, not amplitude

Why this matters
	•	Jamming assumes something is being emitted
	•	LPST links can operate at or below noise floors
	•	Adding noise does not disrupt correlation matching

Use cases
	•	High-interference environments
	•	Dense urban RF congestion
	•	Space and deep-sea comms
	•	Military and emergency services (non-weaponized)

3) Ultra-Low-Power Communication

(Energy cost decoupled from distance)

What’s new

In LPST, distance is correlation cost, not physical separation.

Once a correlation state is established:
	•	maintaining the link is extremely low power
	•	energy cost scales with topology maintenance, not range

Industry impact
	•	Massive IoT networks with multi-year lifetimes
	•	Implantable and remote sensors
	•	Space probes and distributed constellations

This is not “free energy”—it’s amortized correlation setup.

4) Correlation-Multiplexed Bandwidth

(More channels without more spectrum)

What’s new

Instead of multiplexing by:
	•	frequency
	•	time
	•	code
	•	polarization

LPST multiplexes by topological sector.

Multiple channels can:
	•	occupy the same frequency band
	•	pass through the same medium
	•	remain non-interfering

Industry impact
	•	Orders-of-magnitude spectral efficiency increases
	•	Spectrum scarcity becomes less relevant
	•	New regulatory models (channels are not “broadcast”)

⸻

5) Intrinsic Authentication & Anti-Spoofing

(Identity as physics, not credentials)

What’s new

LPST channels require:
	•	correct phase holonomy
	•	correct topological invariants
	•	correct relaxation response

Spoofing requires reproducing the physical topology, not copying bits.

Industry impact
	•	No man-in-the-middle attacks
	•	No replay attacks
	•	Identity verification is continuous and passive

Use cases
	•	Financial transactions
	•	Autonomous systems
	•	Critical infrastructure control
	•	Identity-sensitive networks

6) Loss-Tolerant & Degradation-Graceful Links

(Communication that degrades smoothly, not catastrophically)

What’s new

Traditional comms fail when SNR drops below a threshold.
LPST links degrade as:
	•	partial topology mismatch
	•	slower update convergence

Messages become slower or fuzzier—but don’t drop.

Industry impact
	•	High reliability in marginal environments
	•	Better emergency communications
	•	Improved satellite and deep-space links

⸻

7) New Physical-Layer Privacy Model

(Privacy without encryption)

What’s new

LPST enables privacy by non-existence:
	•	If you don’t share the topology, there is no channel to observe.

This is stronger than encryption:
	•	nothing to crack later
	•	nothing to store for future attacks

Industry impact
	•	Long-term confidentiality (post-quantum and post-AI)
	•	Compliance-friendly privacy (no stored secrets)
	•	New trust models for communications providers

⸻

8) Integration with Classical Networks (Hybrid LPST/EM)

(Not a replacement—an overlay)

LPST does not require abandoning:
	•	fiber optics
	•	RF links
	•	satellites

Instead, it overlays:
	•	correlation encoding on classical carriers
	•	LPST authentication atop existing infrastructure

This allows incremental adoption, not disruption.

⸻

What LPST does not promise
	•	❌ Faster-than-light messaging
	•	❌ Infinite bandwidth
	•	❌ Communication without energy cost
	•	❌ Breaking causality

LPST is strictly causal and physically conservative.

One-sentence industry summary

LPST transforms communications from signal transmission into topology-locked correlation, enabling secure, low-power, jam-resistant channels that cannot be intercepted or spoofed without reproducing the underlying physical phase structure.

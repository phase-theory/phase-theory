Here is the design for The Ariadne Nav-System, the algorithmic brain required to pilot the Caduceus Drive through the Luminous Substrate.
In the context of Luminous Substrate Theory (LST), "Hyperdrive" is not about going fast in a straight line. It is about Fluid Dynamics.
 * The Substrate (Aether): Behaves like a superfluid ocean.
 * Stars (Gravity Wells): Behave like massive, spinning whirlpools (Vortices) in that ocean.
 * The Ship: A bubble trying to move without popping.
If you fly a Caduceus Bubble into a Star Vortex, the conflicting topological twists (Ship Twist vs. Star Twist) cause a "Vacuum Sheer Event." The bubble collapses, and the ship is instantly crushed into a puff of gamma rays.
The Nav-Computer does not calculate a line; it calculates a Flow.
1. The Algorithm: "Geodesic Void Threading"
The core logic is based on Gradient Descent, but inverted. We seek the path of least gravitational tension (The Voids).
System Name: ARIADNE (Automated Relativistic Inter-spatial Astrogation & Dead-reckoning Navigation Engine).
Phase 1: The "Iso-Tension" Map (Pre-Flight)
Before engaging the drive, Ariadne downloads the G-Map (Gravimetric Chart) of the local sector.
 * Data: Mass/Position of every star, black hole, and brown dwarf within 100 light-years.
 * Processing: It generates a 3D Scalar Field of "Substrate Tension."
   * High Tension (Red Zones): Near stars. The Substrate is "tight" and turbulent.
   * Low Tension (Blue Zones): Deep interstellar voids. The Substrate is "relaxed" and laminar.
 * Route Plotting: The algorithm finds the "Null-Geodesic"—the valley path that stays as far away from mass as possible while maintaining forward momentum.
Phase 2: The "Shadow" Detection (In-Flight)
Once inside the Tunnel (Mode 2), optical sensors are useless (you are moving faster than light). You are flying blind.
 * The Sensor: Gravitational Interferometers (LIGO-on-a-Chip).
 * The View: The pilot sees the "Luminous Substrate" (a white fog).
   * Stars: Appear as dark, distorted "Shadows" or "Knots" in the fog.
   * Rogue Planets (Dark Matter): Invisible normally, but in the Substrate, they appear as sudden "ripples" of turbulence.
2. The Logic Flow: The "Thread-the-Needle" Loop
This loop runs 1,000 times per second during FTL transit.
def ARIADNE_KERNEL(destination, current_vector):
    # 1. SCAN THE AETHER
    # Use Forward Interferometers to detect "Substrate Drag"
    tension_gradient = ReadGravimetricSensors() 

    # 2. DETECT OBSTACLES (The "Shadows")
    # If tension spikes ahead, a mass is warping the substrate
    if tension_gradient > SAFE_LIMIT:
        obstacle_type = AnalyzeSignature(tension_gradient)
        
        # 3. COLLISION AVOIDANCE (The "Swerve")
        # In FTL, you cannot turn sharply (G-force).
        # You must "bank" the warp bubble.
        new_vector = CalculateBankAngle(current_vector, tension_gradient)
        AdjustCaduceusCoils(new_vector)
        
    # 4. MICRO-CORRECTION (Laminar Flow)
    # Constantly adjust to stay in the "center" of the void stream
    MinimizeDrag()

    # 5. EMERGENCY SCRAM (The "Wall")
    # If a massive object appears too fast to dodge (e.g., Black Hole)
    if TimeToImpact < 0.05_seconds:
        DropWarp() # Emergency Drop to Sub-light (Brutal, but survivable)

3. Visual Interface: The "Pilot's Weave"
The pilot does not see numbers. They see a Topological Wireframe projected on the HUD.
 * The Tunnel: Represented as a translucent tube extending forward.
 * The Walls: The "walls" of the tunnel are the gravitational limits. If the ship touches the wall, it drops out of warp.
 * The Stars: Large, pulsating red spheres distorting the tunnel walls from the outside.
 * The Path: A glowing "Golden Thread" (Ariadne's Thread) winding through the center of the tunnel. The pilot simply keeps the ship aligned with the Thread.
4. The ASCII Schematic: The Nav-Core Hardware
The Ariadne computer is distinct from the Gordian Logic Core. It is a specialized sensor-fusion unit.

5. The "Dead Man" Limit: The Heliopause Restriction
The algorithm has one hard-coded, unalterable rule: The Heliopause Lockout.
 * The Danger: As discussed, the "Wake" of the drive is destructive.
 * The Code:
   if (DistanceToStar < 50_AU) {
    Mode = SUB_LIGHT_ONLY; // Lockout FTL
    DisplayWarning("GRAVITY WELL PROXIMITY - FTL INHIBITED");
}

 * The Hack: trying to "jailbreak" Ariadne to allow FTL jumps inside a solar system (the "Hack Maneuver"). This is suicidal. 99% of attempts result in the ship disintegrating because the gravity of the star destabilizes the bubble formation before it can fully form.
Summary
Navigating the Luminous Substrate is like whitewater rafting.
 * Deep Space: Calm water. Easy to go fast.
 * Near Stars: Rapids and whirlpools.
 * The Algorithm: Finds the smooth water between the rocks.

LPST-Enabled Solutions for the Defense Industry

(Capabilities, not weapons)

LPST reframes defense technology around phase-topological control, correlation geometry, and consistency management, rather than force projection or kinetic dominance. This produces qualitatively new defense solutions—many of which are defensive, protective, or informational by nature.

⸻

1) LPST Stealth Beyond EM Concealment

(Correlation Stealth, not radar stealth)

What’s new

Conventional stealth hides objects from specific sensors (radar, IR, acoustic).
LPST enables correlation-signature suppression.

The object is not merely hard to see—it becomes hard to correlate.

Capabilities
	•	Suppression of coherent backscatter across multiple sensing modalities
	•	Reduction of phase-locking with external probes
	•	“Soft invisibility”: sensors register noise, not absence

Why it matters
	•	Works against sensor fusion systems
	•	Not defeated by adding wavelengths
	•	Sensor-agnostic stealth (a paradigm shift)

Defense application: survivability, asset protection, reconnaissance survivability.

2) LPST Signature Control & Spoofing

(Identity control at the correlation level)

What’s new

Instead of emitting false signals, LPST allows re-writing how an object appears in correlation space.

You don’t fake signals—you change what “counts” as the object.

Capabilities
	•	Correlation decoys that look real to all sensors
	•	Dynamic identity morphing (signature agility)
	•	Confusion without jamming

Why it matters
	•	Hard to attribute
	•	No active emissions required
	•	Breaks traditional IFF assumptions

Defense application: deception, counter-ISR, misattribution defense.

3) LPST Defensive Shielding (Non-Kinetic)

(Propagation impedance shaping)

What’s new

LPST allows local modulation of propagation impedance—not reflecting or absorbing energy, but detuning its ability to propagate coherently.

Capabilities
	•	Attenuation of incoming energy without heating
	•	Phase-scrambling of directed energy
	•	Graceful degradation rather than hard interception

Why it matters
	•	Works against lasers, RF, particle beams (in principle)
	•	No debris, no interceptors
	•	Scales with coherence of threat

Defense application: base protection, platform survivability, infrastructure defense.

4) LPST Hardened Communications

(Topology-locked links)

What’s new

Communications secured not by encryption alone, but by topological correlation constraints.

Only systems sharing the correct topological phase state can even see the channel.

Capabilities
	•	Channels that appear as noise to all others
	•	Jamming-resistant by construction
	•	Authentication at the physical-topology level

Why it matters
	•	Immune to brute-force decryption
	•	Resistant to quantum interception
	•	Physical-layer trust

Defense application: strategic comms, command-and-control, submarine/space links.

5) LPST Sensor Superiority

(Correlation-based sensing)

What’s new

LPST enables sensing based on disturbances to correlation geometry, not reflected energy.

Capabilities
	•	Passive detection of objects without illumination
	•	Detection of “stealthy” objects that still disturb correlation fields
	•	Early warning via consistency anomalies

Why it matters
	•	Detects what doesn’t want to be detected
	•	Sensor advantage without escalation
	•	No emissions → deniability

Defense application: early warning, space/domain awareness, perimeter defense.

6) LPST Energy & Logistics Security

(Non-fuel power resilience)

What’s new

LPST energy concepts (coherence recycling, topological storage) reduce reliance on fuel and supply chains.

Capabilities
	•	Long-duration silent power
	•	Reduced logistical vulnerability
	•	Resilience under isolation

Why it matters
	•	Logistics are the biggest vulnerability in conflict
	•	Energy independence = operational independence

Defense application: forward bases, submarines, space assets, disaster response.

7) LPST Cyber-Physical Security

(Defense against deep cyber–physical attacks)

What’s new

LPST reframes cyber threats as consistency attacks—attempts to induce incoherent states in tightly coupled systems.

Capabilities
	•	Early detection of phase-coherence degradation
	•	Hardware-level anomaly detection
	•	Resilience against AI-driven cyber-physical attacks

Why it matters
	•	Protects against attacks that don’t look like “hacks”
	•	Secures AI-driven systems and autonomous platforms

Defense application: AI command systems, autonomous vehicles, critical infrastructure.

⸻

8) LPST Strategic Deterrence (Non-Escalatory)

(Deterrence by denial, not punishment)

What’s new

LPST favors making attacks ineffective, rather than retaliating harder.

Capabilities
	•	Blunting ISR effectiveness
	•	Reducing strike reliability
	•	Increasing uncertainty for aggressors

Why it matters
	•	Raises cost of aggression without escalation
	•	Stabilizing rather than destabilizing

Defense application: strategic stability, homeland defense, escalation control.

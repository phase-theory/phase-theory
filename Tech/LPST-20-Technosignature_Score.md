Below is a single, explicit, quantitative LPST technosignature score designed to rank stellar systems by how strongly they exhibit coherence engineering rather than natural astrophysics. It is model-agnostic, additive, and falsifiable.

The LPST Technosignature Score (LTS)

Purpose

Rank stars by the likelihood that their observed stability arises from engineered phase-coherence management rather than natural processes.

The score measures how much a system is too coherent in ways nature rarely produces simultaneously.

⸻

Core principle

Natural astrophysics produces noise with structure.
LPST engineering produces structure with suppressed noise.

The score therefore rewards cross-modal quietness + regularity + persistence.

Definition

\boxed{
\mathrm{LTS}
=
w_1\,Z_{\mathrm{var}}
+
w_2\,Z_{\mathrm{seis}}
+
w_3\,Z_{\mathrm{spec}}
+
w_4\,Z_{\mathrm{pol}}
+
w_5\,Z_{\mathrm{persist}}
-
w_6\,Z_{\mathrm{natural}}
}

Where each Z term is a normalized anomaly score (z-score or percentile) relative to stellar models and matched control populations.

Term-by-term meaning

1) Z_{\mathrm{var}} — Photometric Quietness Anomaly

What it measures:
Suppression of broadband brightness variability compared to stellar type, age, rotation, and activity.

LPST rationale:
Phase-harvesting envelopes damp incoherent oscillations.

High value means:
“Too quiet” for its class.

⸻

2) Z_{\mathrm{seis}} — Asteroseismic Mode Suppression

What it measures:
Unexpected damping or reshaping of stellar oscillation modes (p-modes, g-modes).

LPST rationale:
Coupling to stellar coherence selectively alters mode lifetimes and amplitudes.

High value means:
Oscillation spectra cleaner or more regular than models predict.

⸻

3) Z_{\mathrm{spec}} — Spectral Regularity Residual

What it measures:
Deviation of spectral line shapes from expected turbulent, magnetic, and convective broadening.

LPST rationale:
Phase impedance shaping subtly regularizes emission without absorbing light.

High value means:
Lines are “too well-behaved” across time.

⸻

4) Z_{\mathrm{pol}} — Polarization Stability Anomaly

What it measures:
Long-term stability and low-noise behavior of polarization statistics.

LPST rationale:
Engineered phase environments suppress random polarization drift.

High value means:
Polarization coherence exceeds natural expectations.

⸻

5) Z_{\mathrm{persist}} — Temporal Persistence

What it measures:
How long the above anomalies persist across observation epochs.

LPST rationale:
Engineering is stable; rare natural coincidences decorrelate over time.

High value means:
Anomalies last decades, not months.

⸻

6) Z_{\mathrm{natural}} — Natural Explanation Penalty

What it measures:
Strength of known astrophysical explanations (binarity, inclination effects, magnetic cycles, youth/age edge cases).

LPST rationale:
LPST is a last-resort hypothesis.

High value means:
Good natural explanation exists → subtract strongly.

⸻

Weighting (default, adjustable)

(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, w_6)
=
(1.0,\;1.2,\;0.8,\;0.8,\;1.5,\;2.0)

Why these weights
	•	Persistence matters most (engineering is stable)
	•	Natural explanations are penalized hardest
	•	Seismology is slightly favored (harder to fake naturally)

⸻

Interpretation bands

LTS Range	Interpretation
< 0	Fully natural
0 – 2	Astrophysically interesting
2 – 4	Anomalous, warrants follow-up
4 – 6	Strong LPST candidate
> 6	High-priority LPST technosignature

Important: LTS does not claim proof—only ranking for attention.

⸻

What LTS deliberately ignores
	•	Total luminosity
	•	Infrared excess
	•	Radio beacons
	•	Megastructure transits

Those bias toward Kardashev-style, inefficient civilizations.

⸻

Falsifiability (critical)

An LPST candidate fails if:
	•	anomalies decorrelate with time
	•	a new natural mechanism explains multiple terms simultaneously
	•	coherence metrics drift stochastically rather than remaining bounded

LPST predicts long-lived, low-entropy regularization, not transient oddities.

⸻

One-sentence canonical definition

The LPST Technosignature Score quantifies how improbably coherent, quiet, and temporally stable a stellar system is across independent observables, after penalizing known natural explanations.

⸻

Final insight

Classic SETI asks: “Where is the energy?”
LPST SETI asks: “Where is the noise missing?”

In Luminous Substrate Theory (LST), the traditional "Dyson Sphere" (a shell of solar panels built to capture a star's light) does not exist. It is considered a primitive, "Bronze Age" concept.
Why?
 * Energy Obsolescence: An LST civilization uses Apeiron Cores (Vacuum Decay) and Planck-Downconverters. We extract infinite energy from the empty space between planets. We do not need to wrap a star in foil to catch its photons. That is like building a dam around a candle.
 * Material Inefficiency: Building a solid shell requires dismantling every planet in the system for raw materials. In LST, we need those planets for habitation and "Metric Engineering."
However, LST civilizations DO build massive megastructures around stars. They just serve a different purpose: Propulsion and Computing.
We call this structure The Stellar Caduceus Lattice.
1. The Concept: The Stellar Engine
Instead of catching the star's light, we catch the star's Gravity.
We wrap the star in a cage of Macro-Caduceus Coils.
 * Purpose: To turn the entire Solar System into a spaceship.
 * Why: Galaxies collide. Supernovas happen. Sometimes, a civilization needs to move its entire neighborhood to a safer part of the universe.
2. The Architecture: The "Lantern" Configuration
Unlike a solid shell, the Stellar Caduceus is a "Swarm" of independent, synchronized stations.
 * The Nodes: Thousands of "Titan-Class" Warp Projectors orbiting in a specific geometric lattice (usually an Icosahedron) around the star.
 * The Link: They do not connect physically. They connect via Resonant Metric Tension. They create a "virtual hull" of warped spacetime that envelops the star and all its planets (up to the Kuiper Belt).
 * The Action:
   * The Swarm initiates a System-Wide Warp Field.
   * The Star falls forward into the generated vacuum well.
   * Because gravity is the "glue," the planets (Earth, Mars, Jupiter) naturally follow the Star, dragged along by its gravity well like ducklings following a mother duck.
   * Result: The entire solar system moves at FTL speeds across the galaxy.
3. The Secondary Function: The Gordian-Matrioshka
While the primary purpose is propulsion, the structure also serves as the ultimate Gordian QPU.
 * The "Sink": A star is a massive gravity well. Gravity slows time (Time Dilation).
 * The Calculation: We place Chronos Memory Banks in low orbit (high gravity/slow time) and Gordian Processors in high orbit (low gravity/fast time).
 * The Benefit: The processors can perform millennia of calculations (from their perspective) while only seconds pass for the memory banks below. It creates a Temporal Differential Computer capable of simulating entire universe histories in real-time.

Summary
An LST civilization looks at a Dyson Sphere and sees a wasted opportunity.
 * Dyson Sphere: A cage to catch light (Energy).
 * Caduceus Lattice: A steering wheel to drive the star (Freedom).

LPST Solutions for Mining & Geology

Core shift

Geology is reframed from a study of matter distribution to a study of phase-topological history.

LPST treats mineral deposits, fault systems, and subsurface structures as frozen records of long-term phase-coherence evolution. Valuable resources are not random—they are topological attractors.

⸻

1) Correlation-Based Subsurface Mapping

(Seeing structure without drilling)

What’s new

LPST enables sensing of phase-correlation anomalies in the subsurface that reveal:
	•	ore bodies
	•	voids
	•	fluid reservoirs
	•	fault lines

These anomalies exist before conventional seismic or EM contrasts are strong.

Impact
	•	Reduced exploratory drilling
	•	Lower exploration costs
	•	Earlier identification of economically viable deposits

⸻

2) Deposit Discovery via Topological Attractors

(Why minerals cluster where they do)

What’s new

LPST predicts that:

Valuable mineral deposits form at long-lived phase-consistency minima in geological systems.

This reframes exploration from “search everywhere” to:
	•	identifying historical coherence basins
	•	tracing ancient phase-flow paths
	•	locating stable accumulation nodes

Impact
	•	Higher discovery success rates
	•	Better targeting of rare earths, lithium, strategic metals
	•	Less land disturbance

⸻

3) Early Detection of Geological Hazards

(Instability seen before fracture)

What’s new

LPST allows detection of coherence stress buildup in rock systems prior to:
	•	earthquakes
	•	landslides
	•	subsidence
	•	mine collapses

These stresses manifest as phase-consistency distortion, not mechanical failure.

Impact
	•	Improved mine safety
	•	Better hazard forecasting
	•	Reduced loss of life and infrastructure

⸻

4) Water, Fluid & Gas Mapping

(Resources revealed as flow-coherence patterns)

What’s new

LPST treats subsurface fluids as phase-coupled systems, allowing mapping of:
	•	groundwater reservoirs
	•	hydrothermal flows
	•	oil and gas systems
	•	geothermal resources

Impact
	•	Improved water resource management
	•	Better reservoir characterization
	•	Reduced dry wells

⸻

5) Precision Extraction Planning

(Extract only what is needed)

What’s new

By mapping phase-coherent resource boundaries, LPST enables:
	•	sharper delineation of ore zones
	•	reduced overburden removal
	•	minimized waste rock generation

Impact
	•	Lower environmental footprint
	•	Higher ore recovery efficiency
	•	Reduced tailings volume

⸻

6) Non-Invasive Prospecting in Sensitive Areas

(Explore without disturbing)

What’s new

LPST sensing does not rely on:
	•	blasting
	•	drilling
	•	heavy EM injection

Instead, it reads passive coherence disturbances.

Impact
	•	Exploration in protected or remote areas
	•	Reduced conflict with communities and ecosystems
	•	Faster permitting and regulatory approval

⸻

7) Tailings & Waste Rock Characterization

(Risk assessment by coherence, not chemistry alone)

What’s new

LPST evaluates tailings stability and toxicity as:
	•	coherence mismatch states
	•	long-term phase instability risks

Impact
	•	Early warning of tailings failure
	•	Better remediation planning
	•	Safer long-term storage

⸻

8) Planetary & Space Geology

(Mining beyond Earth)

What’s new

LPST applies naturally to:
	•	Moon
	•	asteroids
	•	Mars

where traditional geological assumptions fail.

LPST can identify:
	•	subsurface ice
	•	metal-rich bodies
	•	structural integrity zones

Impact
	•	Reduced mission risk
	•	Higher yield extraterrestrial resource extraction
	•	Strategic advantage in space resource economics

⸻

9) Geological History Reconstruction

(Understanding how deposits formed)

What’s new

LPST allows reconstruction of:
	•	ancient tectonic flows
	•	crustal coherence evolution
	•	mineralization timelines

This improves predictive geology.

Impact
	•	Better long-term planning
	•	Smarter exploration strategies
	•	Reduced guesswork

⸻

What LPST does not claim
	•	❌ Instant discovery of all resources
	•	❌ Replacement of geological expertise
	•	❌ Elimination of physical sampling
	•	❌ Violation of conservation or environmental laws

LPST augments geoscience, it does not override it.

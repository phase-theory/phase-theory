Abstract

We introduce Phase Theory, a phase-primary framework in which phase is the sole ontological primitive and all physical structure—particles, fields, spacetime, probability, and dynamics—emerges from globally admissible phase configurations. By replacing wavefunctions, fields, and spacetime as primitives with a single consistency-constrained phase substrate, Phase Theory resolves long-standing foundational paradoxes in quantum mechanics and gravity without invoking collapse, intrinsic randomness, hidden variables, or multiverse ontology. We outline the core axioms, demonstrate recovery of standard quantum and relativistic behavior as effective limits, and identify experimentally testable deviations in high-coherence regimes. Phase Theory offers a minimal, internally consistent foundation for physics with clear falsification pathways.

1. Motivation: Why Foundations Still Matter

Modern physics is empirically successful but ontologically fragmented.

Quantum mechanics relies on:
	•	wavefunctions without physical definition,
	•	collapse without dynamics,
	•	probability without cause.

Quantum field theory relies on:
	•	fields defined on spacetime,
	•	infinite renormalization,
	•	vacuum structure with unclear ontology.

General relativity relies on:
	•	spacetime as a geometric primitive,
	•	incompatibility with quantum descriptions.

These frameworks work—but only within their domains.
Their junctions remain paradox-laden.

Phase Theory addresses the source of these paradoxes directly:

an inconsistent choice of primitives.

2. The Core Proposal

Postulate (Phase Primacy)

Phase (Φ) is the sole primitive of physical reality.

All physical phenomena arise from:
	•	configurations of phase,
	•	constrained by global admissibility,
	•	evolving through consistency-preserving reconfiguration.

There are no primitive:
	•	particles,
	•	fields,
	•	wavefunctions,
	•	spacetime points,
	•	observers.

These appear only as effective descriptions.

⸻

3. Admissibility and Global Consistency

Not all phase configurations are allowed.

Admissibility Principle

A physical configuration exists if and only if it satisfies global phase consistency constraints, including:
	•	topological coherence,
	•	bounded distinguishability,
	•	saturation limits on phase gradients.

Inadmissible configurations do not evolve—they do not exist.

This replaces:
	•	collapse postulates,
	•	ad hoc conservation laws,
	•	probabilistic axioms.

4. Emergence of Familiar Physics

4.1 Particles

Particles emerge as:
	•	stable, topologically protected phase defects,
	•	not point objects,
	•	not wave packets.

Their persistence follows from topology, not force.

⸻

4.2 Quantum Mechanics

Quantum behavior arises because:
	•	admissible phase configurations form discrete sectors,
	•	measurement restricts admissibility rather than collapsing states,
	•	probability reflects relative basin structure in phase space.

The Schrödinger equation is recovered as an effective limit, not a fundamental law.

⸻

4.3 Measurement Without Collapse

Measurement is:
	•	a physical interaction that restricts admissible phase structure,
	•	irreversible only when saturation occurs,
	•	fully dynamical and observer-independent.

There is no wavefunction collapse—only phase selection under constraint.

⸻

4.4 Spacetime and Relativity

Spacetime emerges from:
	•	large-scale phase ordering,
	•	gradients in admissible structure.

Lorentz invariance arises as a symmetry of admissible phase relations, not as a background assumption.

Gravity appears as phase refraction, not force mediation.

⸻

5. Probability Without Intrinsic Randomness

Phase Theory does not assume fundamental randomness.

Instead:
	•	probability reflects unresolved phase distinguishability,
	•	randomness decreases with increased admissibility resolution,
	•	Born-rule statistics emerge naturally as basin measures.

This preserves empirical predictions while eliminating irreducible chance.

⸻

6. Resolution of Foundational Paradoxes

Phase Theory dissolves—not interprets—the classic paradoxes:

Paradox	Resolution
Wave–particle duality	No duality; phase defect with extended structure
Collapse	No collapse; admissibility restriction
Bell nonlocality	Global phase constraints without signaling
Schrödinger’s cat	Macroscopic inadmissibility
Many-Worlds	Ontology inflation from wavefunction realism
Quantum gravity	False dichotomy; both emerge from phase

No auxiliary interpretations are required.

⸻

7. Experimental Consequences

Phase Theory is falsifiable.

It predicts deviations from standard quantum and field-theoretic behavior in regimes of:
	•	extreme coherence,
	•	admissibility saturation,
	•	engineered phase geometry.

Examples include:
	•	noise suppression without temperature change,
	•	geometry-dependent interaction shifts,
	•	reversibility of measurement below saturation thresholds.

These tests are tabletop-accessible.

⸻

8. Ontological Economy

Phase Theory uses:
	•	one primitive,
	•	one consistency principle,
	•	no hidden variables,
	•	no multiverse.

Everything else is emergent, effective, and replaceable.

This is not minimalism for its own sake—it is structural necessity.

⸻

9. What Phase Theory Does Not Claim

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	to explain consciousness,
	•	to eliminate mystery,
	•	to replace empirical work,
	•	to be immune to falsification.

It claims only:

to remove contradiction from the foundations of physics.

⸻

10. Conclusion

Phase Theory proposes a single corrective move: replace particles, fields, and wavefunctions as primitives with admissible phase structure. From this move follows a unified, internally consistent account of quantum mechanics, spacetime, probability, and measurement—without collapse, intrinsic randomness, or ontological excess. The theory makes clear experimental predictions and defines its own failure modes.

If correct, Phase Theory does not extend physics.

It clarifies what physics was always describing.

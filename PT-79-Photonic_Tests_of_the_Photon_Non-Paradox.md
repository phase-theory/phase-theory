Photonic Tests of the Photon Non-Paradox

⸻

Abstract

We propose a set of photonic experiments designed to directly test the Photon Non-Paradox Theorem, which asserts that wave–particle duality does not represent a true paradox but an artifact of phase admissibility and measurement geometry. By engineering phase-routing structures, delayed admissibility constraints, and entropy-controlled detection, we show that photons exhibit behavior traditionally labeled “wave-like” or “particle-like” without any ontological transition. Observable signatures include geometry-dependent detection statistics, reversible interference suppression, and continuous morphing between regimes without collapse or complementarity violation.

1. Why the Photon Was Thought Paradoxical

The photon has long appeared contradictory because it:
	•	interferes like a wave,
	•	localizes like a particle,
	•	seems to “decide” behavior based on measurement setup.

This led to:
	•	complementarity postulates,
	•	delayed-choice paradoxes,
	•	interpretational fragmentation.

Phase Theory claims:

no paradox exists—only phase selection under constraint.

This must be tested where the paradox was born: photon optics.

2. The Photon Non-Paradox (Recap)

From Paper 4:
	•	A photon is not a particle or a wave
	•	It is a localized phase defect with extended admissible phase structure
	•	“Wave” and “particle” behaviors reflect which phase distinctions survive measurement

No dual ontology is invoked.

3. Experimental Principle

Principle 79.1 (Behavior Without Ontology Switch)

If the photon non-paradox is correct, then wave-like and particle-like behavior must be continuously deformable by admissibility geometry—without collapse, delayed choice, or complementarity enforcement.

⸻

4. Signature I — Continuous Morphing of Interference

Prediction (Phase Theory):
Interference visibility varies continuously with admissibility routing, not discretely with “which-path” information.

Test:
	•	Implement a Mach–Zehnder interferometer with tunable phase-entropy export paths.
	•	Observe smooth suppression and restoration of interference without introducing which-path markers.

Complementarity predicts sharp tradeoffs.
Phase Theory predicts continuity.

⸻

5. Signature II — Reversible Which-Path Suppression

Prediction:
Which-path distinguishability can be suppressed and restored without erasing information, provided phase entropy has not been exported.

Test:
	•	Introduce controlled admissibility restriction.
	•	Reverse geometry prior to detection.
	•	Recover interference.

True particle behavior would forbid recovery.

⸻

6. Signature III — Geometry-Dependent Detection Statistics

Prediction:
Detection statistics depend on phase-routing geometry even when detectors, timing, and photon number are unchanged.

Test:
	•	Keep detectors fixed.
	•	Alter only admissibility corridors upstream.
	•	Observe systematic shifts in click distributions.

Standard QM predicts invariance.

⸻

7. Signature IV — Delayed Admissibility Without Retrocausality

Prediction:
Delayed changes in admissibility geometry affect outcomes without retrocausality, because phase structure is global.

Test:
	•	Modify admissibility constraints after photon emission but before detection.
	•	Observe outcome shifts without signaling.

This resolves delayed-choice “paradoxes”.

⸻

8. Signature V — No Collapse Point

Prediction:
There is no unique spacetime point where “wave becomes particle”.

Test:
	•	Time-resolve coherence decay and localization.
	•	Observe gradual admissibility restriction rather than instantaneous collapse.

Collapse-based models require a sharp transition.

⸻

9. Tabletop Implementations

These tests are feasible using:
	•	single-photon interferometers,
	•	integrated photonic circuits,
	•	programmable loss and gain elements,
	•	phase cooling pathways (Paper 75).

No exotic detectors are required.

⸻

10. Controlling for Classical Explanations

Controls must rule out:
	•	detector inefficiency artifacts,
	•	hidden which-path marking,
	•	classical wave interference,
	•	post-selection bias.

Phase Theory predicts effects before these explanations apply.

⸻

11. What Would Falsify the Photon Non-Paradox

The theorem fails if:
	•	behavior switches discontinuously,
	•	irreversibility occurs without entropy export,
	•	detection statistics remain geometry-independent,
	•	collapse points are experimentally identifiable.

Phase Theory makes no attempt to evade these outcomes.

⸻

12. Why Photons Are the Right Test

Photons:
	•	are phase-dominant objects,
	•	minimize material decoherence,
	•	allow precise geometry control,
	•	are experimentally mature.

If the non-paradox fails here, it fails everywhere.

⸻

13. Conceptual Payoff

If confirmed:
	•	wave–particle duality dissolves,
	•	complementarity becomes unnecessary,
	•	photons regain a single ontology.

If not:
	•	Phase Theory loses one of its central claims.

Either outcome is decisive.

⸻

14. Conclusion

We have proposed concrete photonic experiments capable of testing the Photon Non-Paradox directly. By demonstrating continuous, reversible, geometry-dependent transitions between wave-like and particle-like behavior—without collapse or complementarity enforcement—these experiments can confirm or refute the claim that the photon was never paradoxical at all.

The photon does not decide how to behave.

It behaves exactly as phase is allowed to.

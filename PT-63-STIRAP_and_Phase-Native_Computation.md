STIRAP and Phase-Native Computation

⸻

Abstract

We show that STIRAP-like processes (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) are not merely experimental techniques but fundamental phase-native computational operations in Phase Theory. Without invoking quantum states, eigenbases, or adiabatic theorems as primitives, we demonstrate that STIRAP corresponds to adiabatic transport of phase coherence between attractor basins under admissibility-preserving deformation. This mechanism enables robust, low-error computation by avoiding population of unstable phase regions altogether. Phase-native computation thus emerges as geometry control rather than state manipulation.

1. Why Gates Are the Wrong Primitive

Standard quantum computation assumes:
	•	discrete gate sets,
	•	state vectors,
	•	unitary evolution.

But physically:
	•	gates are implemented imperfectly,
	•	states decohere,
	•	intermediate excitations cause error.

STIRAP succeeds experimentally because it never goes where error lives.

Phase Theory explains why.

2. What STIRAP Really Does

STIRAP:
	•	transfers population between two states,
	•	without occupying intermediate unstable states,
	•	via counter-intuitive pulse sequencing.

In Phase Theory:
	•	there are no “states” being populated,
	•	only phase coherence being transported.

3. STIRAP as Attractor Transport

Definition 63.1 (Phase-Adiabatic Transport)

Phase-adiabatic transport is the continuous deformation of admissibility geometry such that a phase attractor is moved from one basin to another without crossing inadmissible regions.

STIRAP is precisely this process.

4. Dark Paths and Admissibility Nulls

The STIRAP “dark state” corresponds to:
	•	a null-gradient corridor in admissibility space,
	•	where coherence can move without excitation cost.

No energy gap protection is required.
Only admissibility continuity.

⸻

5. Computation Without Occupation

In phase-native computation:
	•	no intermediate basin is occupied,
	•	no unstable configuration is realized,
	•	errors are geometrically suppressed.

This is not fault tolerance by correction.
It is fault avoidance by design.

⸻

6. Logical Operations via Geometry

Logical operations are implemented by:
	•	shaping admissibility basins,
	•	steering attractors through control space,
	•	merging or separating coherence corridors.

Logic is enacted as geometric choreography.

⸻

7. Multi-Qubit Operations

Multi-qubit STIRAP corresponds to:
	•	shared admissibility deformation across attractor networks,
	•	transport of joint phase coherence,
	•	entangling geometry without pairwise gates.

This scales more naturally than gate-based models.

⸻

8. Robustness to Noise

Noise affects:
	•	phase geometry locally,
	•	but not global attractor connectivity.

As long as the dark corridor remains admissible:
	•	coherence transport succeeds,
	•	errors remain exponentially suppressed.

⸻

9. Relation to Adiabatic Computation

Adiabatic quantum computation is a special case of phase-native computation where:
	•	admissibility deformation is slow,
	•	basin tracking replaces eigenstate tracking.

Phase Theory generalizes this beyond Hamiltonians.

⸻

10. Why STIRAP Works at Room Temperature

STIRAP succeeds even at high temperatures because:
	•	it relies on geometry, not occupation,
	•	coherence is transported, not stored locally,
	•	thermal noise has no handle on null corridors.

This explains experimental robustness.

⸻

11. Implementation Across Platforms

Phase-native STIRAP applies to:
	•	photonic systems,
	•	atomic ensembles,
	•	superconducting circuits,
	•	hybrid photonic-classical devices.

Hardware differences affect geometry, not principle.

⸻

12. Scaling Limits

Scaling is limited by:
	•	admissibility corridor crowding,
	•	phase saturation (Paper 65),
	•	global coherence management.

These limits are structural, not technological.

13. Comparison with Gate Models

Feature	Gate Model	Phase-Native STIRAP
Error source	Occupation	Geometry distortion
Protection	Error correction	Avoidance
Temperature	Low	Broad
Control	Discrete	Continuous

Phase-native computation is closer to how reality actually behaves.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Computation becomes:
	•	physical,
	•	robust,
	•	geometric.

The computer does not flip bits.

It reshapes phase.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that STIRAP-like processes are phase-native computational primitives corresponding to adiabatic transport of coherence between phase attractors. By avoiding unstable configurations entirely, phase-native computation achieves robustness unattainable by gate-based models. STIRAP is not a workaround—it is how computation wants to happen in a phase-governed universe.

The safest computation path
is the one phase never notices.

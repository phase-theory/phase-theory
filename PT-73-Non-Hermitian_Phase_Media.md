Non-Hermitian Phase Media

⸻

Abstract

We formulate non-Hermitian phase media within Phase Theory as systems where admissibility structure includes controlled gain, loss, and asymmetric phase flow without violating global phase consistency. Without invoking non-unitary evolution as a fundamental pathology, we show that non-Hermitian behavior emerges naturally when phase entropy is selectively injected or exported through structured admissibility channels. Exceptional points, PT symmetry, and asymmetric mode transport arise as geometric features of phase space rather than as breakdowns of quantum mechanics. This framework unifies non-Hermitian physics with a consistent ontological foundation.

1. Why Non-Hermitian Physics Looked Dangerous

In conventional quantum theory:
	•	Hermiticity guarantees real spectra and probability conservation,
	•	non-Hermitian terms suggest loss of unitarity,
	•	gain/loss is treated as “effective” or open-system behavior.

This makes non-Hermitian physics appear:
	•	approximate,
	•	suspect,
	•	non-fundamental.

Phase Theory removes the danger by relocating what is conserved.

2. What Is Conserved in Phase Theory

Phase Theory conserves:
	•	global admissibility,
	•	phase consistency,
	•	total distinguishability (Paper 58).

It does not require:
	•	norm conservation,
	•	Hermitian generators,
	•	closed-system isolation.

Loss and gain are admissible—if globally consistent.

3. Non-Hermitian Phase Media Defined

Definition 73.1 (Non-Hermitian Phase Medium)

A non-Hermitian phase medium is a structured admissibility environment in which phase entropy is directionally injected or exported, producing effective gain, loss, and asymmetric phase evolution while preserving global phase consistency.

Non-Hermiticity reflects entropy flow, not fundamental violation.

4. Gain and Loss as Admissibility Routing
	•	Gain corresponds to:
	•	phase coherence injection,
	•	admissibility relaxation unlocking new structure.
	•	Loss corresponds to:
	•	phase entropy export,
	•	coherence demotion into sinks.

Neither violates conservation.
They are directional phase processes.

⸻

5. Exceptional Points as Geometric Singularities

Exceptional points arise when:
	•	admissibility gradients coalesce,
	•	phase modes merge structurally,
	•	distinguishability collapses along specific directions.

These are:
	•	geometric features of phase space,
	•	not eigenvalue accidents.

⸻

6. PT Symmetry Reinterpreted

Parity–time (PT) symmetry corresponds to:
	•	balanced admissibility gain and loss,
	•	mirror-symmetric phase corridors,
	•	net zero entropy flux.

PT symmetry breaking occurs when:
	•	balance fails,
	•	admissibility tilts,
	•	phase flow becomes directional.

No paradox arises.

7. Asymmetric Transport Without Bias

Non-Hermitian phase media support:
	•	one-way phase transport,
	•	non-reciprocal mode flow,
	•	direction-selective amplification.

This does not require:
	•	magnetic fields,
	•	time-reversal violation,
	•	exotic materials.

It requires admissibility asymmetry.

⸻

8. Stability and Control

Stability is achieved by:
	•	bounding gain regions,
	•	coupling loss corridors,
	•	avoiding saturation cascades.

Non-Hermitian does not mean unstable.
It means open but controlled.

⸻

9. Relation to Phase Cooling

Non-Hermitian media are natural components of:
	•	phase cooling architectures (Paper 69),
	•	entropy routing systems,
	•	PTI interfaces (Paper 70).

Gain/loss engineering is entropy management.

⸻

10. Compatibility with Phase Computation

Non-Hermitian phase media enable:
	•	error suppression via loss filtering,
	•	amplification of desired coherence paths,
	•	non-reciprocal computational primitives.

Computation benefits from asymmetry when geometry is controlled.

⸻

11. Photonic Implementations

Photonic systems excel because:
	•	gain/loss is engineerable,
	•	coherence is accessible,
	•	geometry is flexible.

Examples include:
	•	coupled resonator arrays,
	•	waveguides with distributed loss,
	•	active–passive metamaterial lattices.

⸻

12. Avoiding Ontology Leaks

We do not interpret:
	•	gain as particle creation,
	•	loss as destruction,
	•	non-unitarity as fundamental failure.

All are phase bookkeeping effects.

⸻

13. Predictive Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	stability beyond PT-breaking thresholds,
	•	geometry-dependent exceptional point behavior,
	•	coherence-preserving gain regimes.

These differ subtly from standard non-Hermitian models.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Non-Hermitian physics becomes:
	•	legitimate,
	•	fundamental,
	•	intelligible.

Open systems are not approximations.

They are how phase breathes.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that non-Hermitian behavior arises naturally in Phase Theory from structured admissibility that includes directional entropy injection and export. Gain, loss, exceptional points, and PT symmetry are geometric features of phase space—not violations of physical law. Non-Hermitian media are not broken quantum systems.

They are honest about entropy.

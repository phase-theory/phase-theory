Phase-Based Tests of Quantum Randomness

⸻

Abstract

We propose experimental tests to distinguish intrinsic quantum randomness from effective randomness arising from unresolved phase structure, as predicted by Phase Theory. By manipulating phase admissibility, coherence geometry, and entropy export pathways, we show that outcome statistics traditionally regarded as irreducibly random can exhibit controlled bias, correlation, or suppression without violating causality or signaling constraints. These experiments offer a decisive empirical test between standard quantum postulates and phase-primary descriptions of probability.

1. Why Randomness Is the Hardest Claim

Quantum mechanics asserts:
	•	randomness is fundamental,
	•	outcomes are not determined prior to measurement,
	•	probabilities are irreducible.

This claim is unusually strong.
It is also unusually untested.

Phase Theory instead claims:

randomness reflects unresolved phase distinguishability.

Only experiments can decide.

2. What “Random” Means in Phase Theory

From Paper 5 and Paper 58:
	•	probability reflects ensemble statistics over admissible phase configurations,
	•	randomness appears when phase distinctions are inaccessible,
	•	finer admissibility resolution reduces apparent randomness.

Randomness is contextual, not ontological.

3. Experimental Principle

Principle 77.1 (Resolution Dependence of Randomness)

If randomness is intrinsic, outcome statistics must remain invariant under any manipulation that preserves standard quantum observables.

If randomness is phase-based, outcome statistics may change when admissibility structure is modified—even if standard observables are unchanged.

⸻

4. Signature I — Geometry-Dependent Bias

Prediction (Phase Theory):
Measurement outcome distributions depend on admissibility geometry, even when measurement operators are unchanged.

Test:
	•	Perform identical measurements in two systems with different phase-routing geometry.
	•	Compare outcome statistics.

QFT/QM expectation:
Identical statistics.

Any systematic deviation falsifies intrinsic randomness.

5. Signature II — Randomness Suppression via Entropy Export

Prediction (Phase Theory):
Exporting phase entropy prior to measurement reduces outcome randomness.

Test:
	•	Couple system to a phase cooling pathway.
	•	Measure variance reduction without changing temperature or measurement basis.

Intrinsic randomness predicts no effect.

⸻

6. Signature III — Controlled Correlations Without Signaling

Prediction:
Correlations can be introduced between nominally independent measurements through shared admissibility constraints.

Test:
	•	Isolate systems thermally and electromagnetically.
	•	Introduce shared phase admissibility geometry.
	•	Measure cross-correlations.

No signaling occurs, but independence fails.

⸻

7. Signature IV — Randomness Saturation

Prediction:
Randomness does not increase indefinitely with repeated coarse-graining.

Test:
	•	Increase measurement imprecision.
	•	Observe plateau or collapse in entropy growth.

Intrinsic randomness predicts monotonic increase.

⸻

8. Relation to Bell-Type Experiments

Phase Theory:
	•	reproduces Bell violations,
	•	without intrinsic randomness,
	•	via global admissibility constraints.

These tests probe post-Bell structure, not locality.

⸻

9. What Does Not Count

These experiments do not rely on:
	•	hidden variables,
	•	superdeterminism,
	•	retrocausality,
	•	measurement loopholes.

They rely solely on phase structure manipulation.

⸻

10. Experimental Platforms

Candidate systems include:
	•	single-photon interferometers,
	•	superconducting qubits with phase cooling,
	•	photonic lattices with entropy sinks,
	•	room-temperature coherent oscillators.

All are accessible with current technology.

⸻

11. Statistical Requirements

Tests require:
	•	large ensembles,
	•	careful bias analysis,
	•	geometry-controlled comparison.

Small effects are expected—but systematic.

⸻

12. Falsification Criteria

Phase Theory is falsified if:
	•	outcome statistics remain invariant under admissibility manipulation,
	•	randomness cannot be suppressed or structured,
	•	correlations remain strictly factorized.

Intrinsic randomness survives only if no deviation is ever observed.

⸻

13. Why This Matters

If randomness is not fundamental:
	•	cryptography must be reinterpreted,
	•	probability gains physical grounding,
	•	determinism re-enters without hidden variables.

If randomness is fundamental:
	•	Phase Theory must be revised at its core.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

This is not a metaphysical debate.

It is an experimental fork:

Is nature truly random—or just unresolved?

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have proposed a suite of phase-based experimental tests capable of distinguishing intrinsic quantum randomness from effective randomness arising from unresolved phase structure. By manipulating admissibility geometry and entropy export pathways, Phase Theory predicts measurable deviations from invariant quantum statistics. These experiments place the strongest claim of quantum mechanics—irreducible randomness—directly under empirical scrutiny.

If randomness bends under geometry,
it was never fundamental.

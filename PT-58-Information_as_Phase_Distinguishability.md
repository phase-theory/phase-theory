Information as Phase Distinguishability

⸻

Abstract

We define information in Phase Theory as phase distinguishability: the existence and persistence of admissible distinctions between phase configurations. Without invoking bits, Shannon entropy, observers, measurement outcomes, or computational primitives, we show that information is a structural property of admissible phase space. Classical, quantum, and thermodynamic notions of information emerge as effective measures of distinguishability under different coarse-grainings. This formulation unifies information theory with physical ontology and eliminates observer-dependence at the fundamental level.

1. Why Information Has Been Misdefined

In conventional physics, information is treated as:
	•	bits stored in states,
	•	observer-relative knowledge,
	•	abstract measures detached from ontology.

This leads to confusion:
	•	Is information physical?
	•	Where is it stored?
	•	Can it be destroyed?

Phase Theory answers by redefining information structurally.

2. What Information Must Be Fundamentally

Any fundamental definition of information must:
	•	be observer-independent,
	•	be physically grounded,
	•	persist under valid evolution,
	•	not depend on representation.

Bits fail these requirements.
Phase distinguishability does not.

3. Phase Distinguishability Defined

Definition 58.1 (Phase Distinguishability)

Two phase configurations are distinguishable if and only if they cannot be continuously deformed into one another without violating admissibility constraints.

Information exists precisely when:

admissible distinctions persist.

No observer is required.
No encoding is assumed.

⸻

4. Information Exists Without Measurement

Measurement does not create information.

Measurement:
	•	probes existing distinguishability,
	•	projects phase distinctions into coarse outcomes.

Information existed before the measurement.
Measurement merely reveals it.

⸻

5. Information Is Not a Substance

Information is not:
	•	a thing,
	•	a field,
	•	a conserved fluid.

It is a relational property of phase structure.

You do not “store” information.
You maintain distinctions.

⸻

6. Classical Information as Coarse Distinguishability

Classical bits arise when:
	•	admissible phase space is coarse-grained,
	•	only large distinctions remain resolvable,
	•	noise suppresses fine structure.

Binary logic is a projection, not a foundation.

⸻

7. Quantum Information Reinterpreted

Quantum information corresponds to:
	•	fine-grained phase distinguishability,
	•	global constraints across configurations,
	•	non-factorizable admissibility structure.

Entanglement reflects:

inseparable phase distinctions.

No wavefunctions are required.

⸻

8. Entropy as Loss of Distinguishability

Entropy increase corresponds to:
	•	collapse of distinguishable phase regions,
	•	merging of admissible configurations,
	•	reduction of accessible distinctions.

Entropy does not measure ignorance.
It measures indistinguishability growth.

9. Information Conservation

Theorem 58.1 (Phase Information Conservation)

Under admissible phase evolution, total phase distinguishability is conserved globally, though it may become inaccessible under coarse descriptions.

Information is never destroyed.
It is hidden by saturation or projection.

⸻

10. Why Information Appears to Be Lost

Information appears lost when:
	•	phase structure becomes saturated (Paper 47),
	•	geometry fails,
	•	coarse observables cannot resolve distinctions.

This explains:
	•	black hole paradoxes,
	•	decoherence,
	•	thermalization.

⸻

11. No Observer Privilege

Observers are:
	•	phase defects,
	•	embedded within phase structure,
	•	subject to the same admissibility constraints.

There is no privileged informational frame.

⸻

12. Relation to Computation

Computation corresponds to:
	•	controlled manipulation of phase distinguishability,
	•	guided admissibility transitions,
	•	preservation of specific distinctions.

This sets the stage for Papers 61–65.

⸻

13. Information Bounds

Information bounds arise because:
	•	admissibility limits distinguishability density,
	•	phase saturation caps resolution,
	•	no infinite information can exist in finite phase regions.

This replaces holographic postulates with structural limits.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Information becomes:
	•	physical without being material,
	•	objective without observers,
	•	conserved without bookkeeping.

It is no longer mysterious.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that information in Phase Theory is best understood as phase distinguishability: the persistence of admissible distinctions within phase configuration space. Classical and quantum information emerge as effective measures under different coarse-grainings, while global phase evolution preserves all distinctions. Information is not stored, transmitted, or destroyed.

It is whether phase can tell itself apart.

Probability Without Randomness: Statistical Emergence from Phase Admissibility

⸻

Abstract

Probability is traditionally assumed to be a fundamental feature of physical law, irreducible and intrinsic to nature. We demonstrate that within Phase Theory, probability is not primitive and does not reflect intrinsic randomness. Instead, probabilistic behavior emerges as a statistical description of ensembles of admissible phase configurations under coarse-grained access and environmental coupling. The Born rule and related probabilistic structures are shown to arise as effective limits of phase admissibility, without invoking stochastic axioms, collapse postulates, or epistemic randomness. This paper eliminates probability as a foundational concept in physics.

1. The Status of Probability in Physics

Probability enters modern physics as an axiom.

In quantum mechanics:
	•	outcomes are fundamentally probabilistic,
	•	probabilities are postulated (Born rule),
	•	randomness is irreducible.

Yet probability:
	•	has no ontological substrate,
	•	is not directly observable,
	•	appears only in ensembles.

Phase Theory rejects probability as a primitive and asks instead:

What physical structure gives rise to probabilistic descriptions?

2. Phase Theory Contains No Random Variables

From Papers 1–4:
	•	Φ is continuous and deterministic in admissible evolution.
	•	Forbidden configurations do not occur.
	•	Measurement resolves admissible phase structure.
	•	Discreteness arises topologically.

Nowhere is randomness introduced.

Therefore, any appearance of probability must be emergent.

3. Ensemble Formation in Phase Space

Definition 5.1 (Admissible Ensemble)

An admissible ensemble is the set:
\mathcal{E} = \{\Phi_i \mid \mathcal{I}[\Phi_i] \ge 0\}
compatible with:
	•	fixed macroscopic constraints,
	•	limited control,
	•	environmental coupling.

Each \Phi_i is fully admissible and deterministic.

⸻

Key Observation

Probability does not describe which configuration occurs.

It describes:

the relative frequency of admissible resolutions under repeated coarse-grained preparation.

⸻

4. Coarse-Graining and Information Loss

No physical agent has access to the full phase configuration Φ.

Instead:
	•	preparation fixes only a subset of constraints,
	•	uncontrolled degrees of freedom remain,
	•	admissibility allows multiple compatible Φ.

This induces statistical description, not stochastic dynamics.

5. Definition of Probability (Derived)

Definition 5.2 (Emergent Probability)

The probability of an outcome O is:
P(O) = \frac{|\{\Phi_i \in \mathcal{E} \mid \Phi_i \rightarrow O\}|}{|\mathcal{E}|}

Probability is therefore:
	•	relative,
	•	ensemble-based,
	•	non-fundamental.

6. Emergence of the Born Rule

In quantum mechanics, the Born rule assigns probabilities proportional to squared amplitudes.

In Phase Theory:
	•	amplitudes correspond to phase density over admissible sectors,
	•	squared magnitude arises from phase-area weighting in configuration space,
	•	interference arises from overlapping admissible sectors.

Thus:
P \sim \text{phase-admissible measure}

The Born rule is not postulated; it is a geometric consequence of admissible phase measure.

A detailed derivation is deferred to Appendix B and expanded in Paper 6.

7. Why Outcomes Are Unpredictable but Not Random

Each individual outcome is fully determined by Φ.

However:
	•	Φ is globally inaccessible,
	•	small uncontrolled variations lead to different admissible resolutions,
	•	prediction beyond ensemble statistics is physically impossible.

This yields effective unpredictability without ontological randomness.

8. Comparison with Classical Probability

Classical Probability	Phase-Theoretic Probability
Epistemic ignorance	Structural underdetermination
Random variables	Admissible configurations
Stochastic laws	Deterministic admissibility
External measure	Intrinsic phase measure

Phase Theory therefore unifies classical and quantum probability under a single mechanism.

⸻

9. Measurement Statistics

Repeated measurements do not reveal intrinsic randomness.

They reveal:
	•	the statistical distribution of admissible phase resolutions,
	•	shaped by preparation, environment, and apparatus.

This explains:
	•	reproducible frequencies,
	•	apparatus dependence,
	•	contextuality.

⸻

10. No Hidden Variables

Phase Theory is not a hidden-variable theory.

Φ is not a hidden variable because:
	•	it is not additional structure,
	•	it is the only structure,
	•	nothing is hidden behind it.

There is no underlying stochastic process to uncover.

11. Resolution of Foundational Tensions

This paper resolves:
	•	Randomness vs determinism
	•	Born rule axiomatic status
	•	Measurement unpredictability
	•	Probability ontological ambiguity

All without introducing new primitives.

⸻

12. Implications
	•	Probability is not fundamental.
	•	Randomness is descriptive, not ontological.
	•	Determinism and unpredictability coexist.
	•	Collapse is unnecessary.
	•	Quantum mysticism is avoidable.

⸻

13. Relation to Measurement

Probability describes ensembles of measurement outcomes.

Measurement itself is addressed structurally in Paper 6, which removes collapse entirely.

⸻

14. Conclusion

We have shown that probability arises naturally from statistical distributions over admissible phase configurations under coarse-grained access. Randomness is not a feature of reality, but of description.

Nature does not roll dice.

It resolves phase.

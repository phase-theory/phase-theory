Phase Admissibility and the Global Consistency Functional

⸻

Abstract

We introduce the phase admissibility functional \mathcal{I}[\Phi], a global consistency measure that determines which phase configurations are physically realizable. This functional replaces the roles traditionally played by action principles, equations of motion, and probabilistic postulates. Physical evolution is defined as admissible transformation of phase configurations that preserve or extremize \mathcal{I}. We show that discreteness, stability, and effective dynamics arise necessarily from admissibility constraints alone, without assuming spacetime, fields, or time as primitives. This paper establishes the operational core of Phase Theory.

1. Motivation

In Paper 1, physical reality was reduced to a single primitive: phase (Φ). However, primacy alone is insufficient. A theory must explain:
	•	why some configurations exist and others do not,
	•	why structure is stable,
	•	why evolution appears ordered rather than arbitrary.

Traditional physics addresses these questions using:
	•	action functionals,
	•	equations of motion,
	•	probabilistic rules.

Phase Theory replaces all three with a single object: a global admissibility functional.

2. The Need for Admissibility

If all phase configurations were equally allowed, physical reality would be maximally chaotic and unstructured. The existence of persistent structure implies selection.

However, selection cannot be imposed ad hoc. It must arise from constraints intrinsic to Φ itself.

We therefore require a criterion that:
	1.	Operates globally,
	2.	Enforces coherence and stability,
	3.	Does not presuppose time or spacetime,
	4.	Does not invoke probability.

This criterion is phase admissibility.

3. Definition of the Admissibility Functional

Definition 2.1 (Admissibility Functional)

Let \Phi denote a global phase configuration.

Define the functional:
\mathcal{I}[\Phi] \in \mathbb{R}

such that:
	•	\mathcal{I}[\Phi] \ge 0 ⇔ Φ is physically admissible,
	•	\mathcal{I}[\Phi] < 0 ⇔ Φ is physically forbidden.

\mathcal{I} is not an action in the classical sense. It does not integrate over time, nor is it minimized along trajectories. It evaluates global consistency of a configuration.

⸻

4. Structural Requirements on \mathcal{I}

The admissibility functional must satisfy the following conditions.

Requirement I — Globality

\mathcal{I} depends on Φ as a whole, not solely on local values.

This forbids purely local dynamics and ensures non-separable constraints.

⸻

Requirement II — Coherence Sensitivity

\mathcal{I} penalizes incoherent phase fragmentation.

Highly oscillatory or discontinuous configurations reduce admissibility unless protected by topology.

⸻

Requirement III — Topological Awareness

\mathcal{I} must distinguish between:
	•	trivial phase variation,
	•	nontrivial winding,
	•	protected defects.

This requirement enables stable particle-like structures.

⸻

Requirement IV — Scale Neutrality

\mathcal{I} must not privilege any absolute scale.

This allows both microscopic and macroscopic structures to arise from the same principle.

5. Decomposition of the Functional

While the explicit form of \mathcal{I} is not unique, all admissible forms admit a conceptual decomposition:

\mathcal{I}[\Phi] =
\mathcal{C}[\Phi]
+ \mathcal{T}[\Phi]
+ \mathcal{S}[\Phi]

where:
	•	\mathcal{C}: coherence contribution
	•	\mathcal{T}: topological contribution
	•	\mathcal{S}: stability contribution

This decomposition is structural, not additive in a classical sense.

⸻

5.1 Coherence Term \mathcal{C}[\Phi]

\mathcal{C} penalizes excessive local phase gradients and incoherent oscillation.

Physically, this term enforces smoothness and suppresses unbounded variation.

⸻

5.2 Topological Term \mathcal{T}[\Phi]

\mathcal{T} rewards nontrivial topological configurations that cannot be continuously deformed into trivial ones.

This term is responsible for:
	•	defect stability,
	•	quantized charges,
	•	protected modes.

⸻

5.3 Stability Term \mathcal{S}[\Phi]

\mathcal{S} ensures that small perturbations do not catastrophically reduce admissibility.

Configurations that are admissible but unstable are dynamically irrelevant.

⸻

6. Admissible Evolution

Definition 2.2 (Phase Evolution)

An evolution from Φ₁ to Φ₂ is physical if and only if:
	1.	Both Φ₁ and Φ₂ are admissible,
	2.	All intermediate configurations remain admissible,
	3.	\mathcal{I} does not decrease catastrophically.

There is no fundamental notion of time. Evolution is an ordering relation over admissible configurations.

⸻

7. Emergence of an Action Principle (Derived)

In regimes where phase configurations can be smoothly parameterized, admissible evolution approximates an extremization principle:

\delta \mathcal{I}[\Phi] \approx 0

This is not postulated. It emerges as a local approximation to global admissibility.

Classical action principles are recovered as effective descriptions in this limit.

⸻

8. Forbidden Configurations and Physical Impossibility

Configurations with \mathcal{I}[\Phi] < 0 are not dynamically unstable—they are nonexistent.

This replaces:
	•	forbidden trajectories,
	•	boundary conditions,
	•	collapse postulates.

Paradoxes arise when forbidden configurations are mistakenly treated as physical.

⸻

9. Relation to Probability

Probability does not appear in \mathcal{I}.

Statistical behavior emerges only when:
	•	multiple admissible configurations exist,
	•	coarse-grained access prevents discrimination.

This derivation is deferred to Paper 5.

10. Comparison to Traditional Action Functionals

Classical Action	Phase Admissibility
Time-integrated	Global
Trajectory-based	Configuration-based
Requires spacetime	Pre-spacetime
Minimization postulate	Admissibility constraint

The action principle is therefore derived, not fundamental.

11. Consequences Preview

From the existence of \mathcal{I}[\Phi], the following follow necessarily:
	•	Discrete spectra (Paper 3)
	•	Particle-like defects (Paper 7)
	•	Measurement consistency (Paper 6)
	•	Non-paradoxical photons (Paper 4)
	•	Thermodynamic behavior (Paper 8)

⸻

12. Falsifiability

Phase Theory is falsified if:
	•	no admissibility functional can reproduce observed stable structures,
	•	or admissible evolution contradicts empirical continuity.

This paper therefore exposes the theory to meaningful risk.

⸻

13. Conclusion

We have introduced the global admissibility functional \mathcal{I}[\Phi], the central dynamical object of Phase Theory. It replaces equations of motion, probabilistic axioms, and collapse rules with a single consistency criterion grounded in phase primacy.

All subsequent physical structure emerges from this functional.

Phase Entropy and Information Bounds

⸻

Abstract

We derive fundamental bounds on information storage, transmission, and resolution in Phase Theory from phase entropy and admissibility constraints, without invoking Shannon entropy as primitive, holographic postulates, or spacetime-based limits. Information bounds arise because admissible phase distinguishability is finite and saturable within any bounded phase region. Classical, quantum, and gravitational information bounds emerge as effective descriptions of the same underlying structural limitation: phase cannot support infinite distinguishability. This framework unifies entropy bounds across physics and resolves their apparent diversity.

1. Why Information Bounds Need a Foundation

Known information bounds include:
	•	Shannon capacity limits,
	•	quantum no-cloning constraints,
	•	Bekenstein bounds,
	•	holographic entropy limits.

These appear unrelated and ad hoc.

Phase Theory asks:

What do all bounds actually constrain?

The answer: phase distinguishability density.

2. Phase Entropy Revisited

From Papers 5, 48, and 58:
	•	phase entropy measures admissible distinguishability,
	•	not disorder or ignorance,
	•	not ensemble counting.

High entropy means:

many admissible configurations are indistinguishable under available resolution.

⸻

3. Finite Distinguishability Principle

Principle 59.1 (Finite Phase Distinguishability)

In any bounded admissible phase region, the number of mutually distinguishable phase configurations is finite.

This is not a postulate.
It follows from:
	•	admissibility smoothness,
	•	topological constraints,
	•	saturation limits.

⸻

4. Information Density Bounds

Theorem 59.1 (Phase Information Density Bound)

There exists a maximum information density per unit admissible phase volume, beyond which additional distinctions cannot be maintained.

Attempts to exceed this density result in:
	•	phase saturation,
	•	indistinguishability,
	•	loss of resolvable information.

⸻

5. Recovery of the Bekenstein Bound

The Bekenstein bound emerges because:
	•	energy increases admissibility curvature,
	•	curvature reduces distinguishable phase volume,
	•	entropy scales with boundary-accessible distinctions (Paper 48).

The bound is not about gravity.
It is about phase crowding.

⸻

6. Holographic Limits Without Holography

Area-scaling arises when:
	•	interior phase structure saturates,
	•	only boundary-consistent distinctions remain accessible.

No holographic principle is assumed.
Area laws emerge structurally.

⸻

7. Quantum Information Limits

Quantum limits arise because:
	•	fine-grained phase distinctions cannot be copied,
	•	admissibility constraints forbid cloning of global phase structure.

No-cloning is not a quantum rule.
It is a phase geometry constraint.

⸻

8. Classical Channel Capacity

Classical channel capacity reflects:
	•	maximum rate of maintaining distinguishability under noise,
	•	admissibility erosion during transmission.

Noise is not randomness.
It is distinguishability decay.

⸻

9. Computational Limits

Limits on computation arise because:
	•	each logical operation consumes admissible distinguishability,
	•	phase resources are finite,
	•	saturation halts further reliable operations.

This anticipates Papers 64–65.

⸻

10. Why Infinite Precision Is Impossible

Infinite precision would require:
	•	infinite phase distinguishability density,
	•	zero admissibility tolerance.

Phase Theory forbids both.

Thus:
	•	real numbers are descriptive tools,
	•	not physically instantiable states.

⸻

11. Relation to Measurement

Measurement resolution is bounded because:
	•	phase structure cannot support arbitrarily fine partitions,
	•	attempting to resolve beyond admissibility yields noise.

Measurement uncertainty is structural, not epistemic.

⸻

12. Unified View of Entropy Bounds

All entropy and information bounds reduce to:

finite admissible phase distinguishability.

Different bounds describe:
	•	different coarse-grainings,
	•	different projections,
	•	the same structural limit.

⸻

13. Predictive Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	breakdown of standard entropy formulas near saturation,
	•	bounded information throughput in extreme regimes,
	•	deviations from naive scaling at high coherence density.

These are testable in principle.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Information bounds are no longer mysterious.
They are inevitable.

Physics does not limit information arbitrarily.
It limits how finely phase can tell itself apart.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that fundamental information bounds arise in Phase Theory from finite phase distinguishability and admissibility saturation. Classical, quantum, and gravitational entropy bounds are unified as manifestations of the same structural constraint. Information is limited not by technology, observers, or geometry—but by phase itself.

There is no infinite information.

Because phase has finite patience.

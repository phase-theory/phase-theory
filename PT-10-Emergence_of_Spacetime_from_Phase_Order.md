Emergence of Spacetime from Phase Order

⸻

Abstract

We demonstrate that spacetime is not a fundamental arena in which physics occurs, but an emergent relational structure arising from ordered phase variation within the global phase substrate Φ. Distance, duration, geometry, and causal structure are shown to arise from coherence relations and admissible gradients of phase. Lorentz invariance and metric structure emerge as effective symmetries of stable phase order, while gravity is identified as large-scale phase curvature. No spacetime manifold, metric, or coordinate system is assumed a priori. This paper replaces spacetime primacy with phase order as the underlying physical substrate.

1. The Spacetime Assumption

Modern physics assumes spacetime as fundamental.
	•	Classical mechanics presumes absolute space and time.
	•	Relativity elevates spacetime to a dynamical entity.
	•	Quantum theory presupposes spacetime as a background for operators and fields.

Yet spacetime raises unresolved questions:
	•	Why does spacetime exist at all?
	•	Why does it have its particular dimensionality?
	•	Why does it possess Lorentz symmetry?
	•	Why does gravity act geometrically?

Phase Theory rejects the assumption.

If phase Φ is fundamental, then spacetime must be derived, not assumed.

2. Phase Order as the Pre-Geometric Substrate

From Papers 1–9:
	•	Φ is global and continuous,
	•	admissibility constrains variation,
	•	particles are phase defects,
	•	fields are phase descriptions,
	•	thermodynamics reflects phase dispersion.

Nowhere has spacetime been required.

Instead, what is required is order:
	•	stable relational structure,
	•	consistent adjacency,
	•	constrained propagation.

This order is provided by phase coherence.

3. Relational Distance from Phase Coherence

Definition 10.1 (Phase Distance)

Define the effective distance between two events as a function of the minimum admissible phase transformation required to relate them.

Distance is not primitive length.
It is relational phase separation.

Highly coherent regions appear “near.”
Weakly coherent regions appear “far.”

4. Emergence of Spatial Dimensions

Spatial dimensions arise from:
	•	independent directions of stable phase variation,
	•	orthogonal coherence gradients,
	•	admissibility-preserving degrees of freedom.

Dimensionality is therefore:
	•	emergent,
	•	contingent,
	•	stability-selected.

Three extended spatial dimensions correspond to the maximal number of mutually stable large-scale phase gradients.

5. Time as Phase Ordering

Definition 10.2 (Emergent Time)

Time is the ordering parameter of admissible phase transformation.

There is no flowing time.
There is only:
	•	before and after,
	•	defined by admissible ordering.

Clock readings correspond to:
	•	periodic phase structures counting admissible transitions.

This replaces time-as-dimension with time-as-order.

6. Causal Structure Without Spacetime

Causality arises from:
	•	admissibility propagation limits,
	•	coherence speed constraints,
	•	topological protection.

No influence propagates faster than phase admissibility permits.

This reproduces relativistic causal structure without postulating light cones.

7. Lorentz Symmetry as Emergent Invariance

Lorentz invariance is not fundamental.

It emerges because:
	•	admissible phase relations preserve invariant coherence intervals,
	•	transformations preserving phase order leave physics unchanged.

At sufficiently coarse scales, this invariance is exact.
At finer scales, deviations are possible in principle.

⸻

8. Metric Structure from Phase Gradients

The spacetime metric arises as a second-order description of phase gradient relations.

Curvature corresponds to:
	•	non-uniform phase admissibility,
	•	constrained coherence flow.

Flat spacetime corresponds to uniform phase order.
Curved spacetime corresponds to structured phase distortion.

⸻

9. Gravity as Phase Curvature

Proposition 10.1

Gravitational phenomena arise from large-scale phase curvature induced by stable defects and mass-like phase inertia.

Mass bends phase.
Phase curvature redirects admissible propagation.
Objects follow admissible paths of maximal phase consistency.

No gravitational force is required.

⸻

10. Equivalence Principle Reinterpreted

The equivalence principle arises because:
	•	phase curvature affects all admissible configurations equally,
	•	motion follows phase structure, not force.

This explains why gravitational and inertial effects are indistinguishable.

⸻

11. Singularities Without Breakdown

Traditional spacetime singularities signal:
	•	breakdown of geometric description.

In Phase Theory:
	•	singularities correspond to phase saturation limits,
	•	admissibility prevents physical divergence,
	•	no infinite curvature exists.

Black holes are addressed fully in Paper 13.

12. Cosmological Expansion

Cosmic expansion corresponds to:
	•	global phase drift,
	•	gradual relaxation of phase coherence density,
	•	redistribution of admissible phase structure.

Expansion is not “space stretching.”
It is phase reordering.

⸻

13. Recovery of General Relativity

General relativity is recovered as:
	•	a low-resolution effective theory,
	•	describing phase curvature geometrically.

Einstein’s equations emerge as:
	•	consistency conditions on large-scale phase gradients.

GR is correct—but not fundamental.

⸻

14. Experimental Consistency

This framework reproduces:
	•	time dilation,
	•	length contraction,
	•	gravitational lensing,
	•	orbital dynamics,
	•	cosmological redshift.

No contradiction with observation arises.

Potential deviations appear only at extreme coherence scales.

⸻

15. Ontological Economy

After this paper:
	•	Spacetime is not fundamental,
	•	Geometry is descriptive,
	•	Coordinates are bookkeeping,
	•	Reality is phase order.

Physics requires no background arena.

⸻

16. Conclusion

We have shown that spacetime emerges from ordered phase relations governed by global admissibility. Distance, time, geometry, and gravity are not primitives but effective descriptions of stable phase order.

The universe does not exist in spacetime.

Spacetime exists in phase.

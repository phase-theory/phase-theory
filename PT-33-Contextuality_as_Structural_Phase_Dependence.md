Contextuality as Structural Phase Dependence

⸻

Abstract

We derive quantum contextuality as a necessary consequence of structural dependence on admissible phase geometry rather than as a peculiarity of measurement or observer intervention. Within Phase Theory, outcome assignments depend on the global admissibility context in which a distinction is imposed, not on pre-existing local properties. We show that contextuality arises whenever admissible phase configurations admit multiple incompatible partitions, and we recover all standard contextuality results—including Kochen–Specker-type impossibility theorems—without invoking wavefunctions, hidden variables, or measurement-induced collapse. Contextuality is thus revealed to be an objective structural feature of phase-consistent reality.

1. Why Contextuality Must Be Structural

In standard quantum foundations, contextuality is often framed as:
	•	dependence on measurement choice,
	•	failure of noncontextual hidden variables,
	•	an epistemic limitation.

This framing suggests subjectivity or observer dependence.

Phase Theory rejects this interpretation.

Contextuality is not about measurement.
It is about which structural distinctions are admissible simultaneously.

2. What “Context” Means in Phase Theory

Definition 33.1 (Context)

A context is a globally admissible partition of phase configuration space induced by a compatible set of distinctions (observables).

A context specifies:
	•	how phase space is carved,
	•	which equivalence classes are distinguished,
	•	which distinctions are jointly admissible.

Contexts are structural objects, not experimental choices.

⸻

3. Structural Incompatibility of Partitions

Admissible phase manifolds generally admit multiple inequivalent partitions.

Two partitions are incompatible if:
	•	no admissible refinement exists that preserves both simultaneously.

This incompatibility is topological, not operational.

⸻

4. Definition of Contextuality (Phase-Theoretic)

Definition 33.2 (Structural Contextuality)

A system is contextual if there exists no single global assignment of outcomes consistent with all admissible partitions of its phase configuration space.

This is a statement about global consistency, not local disturbance.

⸻

5. Kochen–Specker Theorem Reinterpreted

The Kochen–Specker theorem shows that:
	•	noncontextual value assignments are impossible.

In Phase Theory, this is expected.

Proposition 33.1

If admissible phase topology admits incompatible partitions, then no global noncontextual assignment exists.

Kochen–Specker impossibility is therefore:
	•	a corollary of admissibility geometry,
	•	not a mystery about “quantum values.”

⸻

6. No Pre-Existing Values

Phase Theory denies:
	•	intrinsic values of observables,
	•	hidden assignments awaiting revelation.

Outcomes are context-consistent selections, not revealed properties.

This avoids:
	•	value realism problems,
	•	counterfactual definiteness traps.

⸻

7. Measurement Without Privilege

Measurement does not:
	•	create contextuality,
	•	introduce disturbance as a cause,
	•	select reality arbitrarily.

Measurement merely:
	•	imposes a specific admissible partition,
	•	forces a consistent selection within that partition.

Contextuality existed before the measurement.

8. Relation to Non-Commutativity

Non-commuting observables correspond to:
	•	incompatible admissible partitions,
	•	not incompatible physical actions.

Non-commutativity is a shadow of contextual admissibility.

⸻

9. Contextuality vs Nonlocality

Contextuality is:
	•	local in space,
	•	global in structure.

Nonlocality concerns:
	•	joint constraints across subsystems.

Contextuality concerns:
	•	incompatibility of distinctions within a system.

Both arise from the same source:
global admissibility.

⸻

10. State-Independent Contextuality

Certain systems exhibit contextuality regardless of preparation.

Phase Theory explains this as:
	•	topology of admissible phase space,
	•	not contingent phase configuration.

Contextuality is sometimes built into the structure.

⸻

11. Contextuality and Probability

Probability arises because:
	•	multiple admissible selections exist within a context,
	•	but no global selection spans all contexts.

This reinforces Paper 5:
probability reflects admissible multiplicity, not ignorance.

⸻

12. Why Classical Physics Is Noncontextual

Classical regimes correspond to:
	•	deep admissibility basins,
	•	trivial topology,
	•	unique global partitions.

Contextuality disappears when:
	•	admissibility geometry collapses to a single compatible structure.

This explains the classical limit naturally.

⸻

13. Experimental Contextuality Tests

All known contextuality experiments are recovered:
	•	Kochen–Specker setups,
	•	Peres–Mermin squares,
	•	state-independent contextuality tests.

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	no violation beyond quantum bounds,
	•	because admissibility geometry is constrained.

⸻

14. Relation to Computation and Advantage

Quantum computational advantage arises partly from:
	•	exploiting contextual admissibility structures,
	•	not from “parallel worlds.”

Contextuality is a structural resource, not a magical one.

⸻

15. What Contextuality Is Not

Contextuality is not:
	•	observer dependence,
	•	epistemic limitation,
	•	measurement disturbance,
	•	collapse artifact.

It is structural dependence.

⸻

16. Implications

This paper establishes that:
	•	contextuality is inevitable,
	•	hidden-variable realism fails structurally,
	•	measurement has no special ontological role,
	•	quantum logic reflects admissibility geometry.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have shown that contextuality arises inevitably from the structural dependence of admissible phase partitions. It reflects the impossibility of imposing a single global assignment across incompatible admissible distinctions. Contextuality is therefore not a quantum oddity but a direct manifestation of global phase consistency.

Reality does not contradict itself.

Our attempted descriptions do—unless context is respected.

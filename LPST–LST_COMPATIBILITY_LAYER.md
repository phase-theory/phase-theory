LPST–LST COMPATIBILITY LAYER

A Formal Interface Between Phase-Primary and Luminous-Phenomenological Descriptions

Status: Canonical compatibility specification

Purpose: Prevent category errors, false contradictions, and misleading intuitions when using LPST and LST together

⸻

1. Layering Principle (Non-Negotiable)

Layer Assignment
	•	LPST = ontological hardware layer
(phase geometry, global consistency, topology, defect sectors)
	•	LST = effective phenomenological layer
(light-as-medium, refractive gravity, trapped-light intuition)

Rule 1: Any statement in LST that appears fundamental must be reinterpreted as emergent from LPST.

This mirrors:
	•	hardware vs software,
	•	microphysics vs hydrodynamics,
	•	field equations vs effective media.

2. Concept Mapping Table (LPST → LST)

This table defines what each LST concept really is in LPST terms.

LST Concept	LPST Interpretation
Light as substrate	Dominant propagating excitation of phase substrate
EM field	Coherent phase-propagation mode
Vacuum	Globally consistent, low-inconsistency phase configuration
Matter = trapped light	Topologically stabilized phase defect (TDQT)
Standing wave	Local minimum of global phase-inconsistency functional
Mass	Phase circulation / internal update burden
Time	Ordered phase-update bookkeeping
Space	Interference/relational volume of phase propagation
Gravity	Phase-consistency–driven metric response
Refractive index n(x)	Emergent macroscopic proxy for phase strain
Entanglement	Shared topological phase structure
Instant correlation	Nonlocal constraint satisfaction (not signal)
Black hole	Maximally saturated phase knot / causal blockade
Dark matter	Weakly coupled phase-topology sector

Rule 2: LST variables (e.g., refractive index, trapped waves) are coarse-grained observables, not primitives.

3. Permitted Interpretations (Safe Statements)

These statements are always safe to make when stacking LPST and LST.

Safe Statement Class A — Emergent Language
	•	“Light behaves as if it were the substrate at observable scales.”
	•	“Matter appears as trapped light due to phase closure.”
	•	“Gravity acts like refraction of the vacuum.”

These explicitly signal emergence.

⸻

Safe Statement Class B — Correlation Language
	•	“Entangled systems behave as a single extended phase object.”
	•	“Correlations are enforced globally by substrate consistency.”

No causality violation implied.

⸻

Safe Statement Class C — Effective Limits
	•	“At macroscopic scales, LPST reduces to LST phenomenology.”
	•	“LST captures the dominant low-energy modes of LPST.”

4. DO-NOT-SAY LIST (Unless Reinterpreted)

These phrases create contradictions if taken literally.

❌ “Light is the substrate”

Problem: conflicts with LPST’s phase primacy
Fix:

“Light is the dominant propagating excitation of the substrate.”

⸻

❌ “Entanglement transmits instant physical influence”

Problem: violates PLQC
Fix:

“Entanglement enforces instantaneous correlation without signal propagation.”

⸻

❌ “Time literally stops inside a black hole”

Problem: breaks global update consistency
Fix:

“Outward phase propagation halts; internal phase dynamics decouple.”

⸻

❌ “Matter is just a standing wave”

Problem: ignores topological protection
Fix:

“Matter is a topologically stabilized phase structure describable as a standing-wave pattern.”

⸻

❌ “Gravity is nothing but refraction”

Problem: inverts causality
Fix:

“Refractive behavior is the macroscopic manifestation of phase-consistency–driven metric response.”

⸻

❌ “The vacuum is electromagnetic light”

Problem: conflates excitation with substrate
Fix:

“The vacuum is a balanced, globally coherent phase state supporting EM modes.”

5. Cross-Theory Paradox Handling Rules

Rule P1 — If a paradox disappears at the LPST layer, it was an LST artifact

Example: standing-wave decay vs defect stability.

⸻

Rule P2 — If a paradox survives LPST, it is irreducible

Example:
	•	“Why this universe?”
	•	“Why these initial phases?”

⸻

Rule P3 — Never use LST intuition to argue against LPST axioms

LST is not allowed to veto LPST.

⸻

6. Shared Paradoxes (Explicitly Acknowledged)

Both theories inherit the following irreducible paradoxes:
	1.	Single realized universe vs many possible configurations
	2.	First update / origin of ordering
	3.	Observer self-reference
	4.	Existence without strong interaction
	5.	Continuum giving rise to discreteness

Rule: These are not flaws; they are closure boundaries per the Paradox Completion Theorem.

⸻

7. What Each Theory Is Not Allowed to Claim

LPST is not allowed to claim:
	•	“Light is fundamental”
	•	“All phenomenology is obvious from phase geometry”
	•	“Paradoxes are eliminated”

⸻

LST is not allowed to claim:
	•	“Instant causation”
	•	“Substrate propagation literally halts”
	•	“Standing waves explain stability by themselves”
	•	“Refractive index is fundamental”

⸻

8. Final Compatibility Statement (Canonical)

LPST defines what reality is allowed to be.
LST describes how that reality appears when phase dynamics are dominated by luminous propagation.
LST is true as an effective description; LPST is true as an ontological one.
Any apparent contradiction arises from mistaking one layer for the other.

⸻

9. One-Sentence Summary

LPST is the hardware that enforces possibility; LST is the software that explains appearance.
Conflicts only arise when software metaphors are mistaken for hardware truths.

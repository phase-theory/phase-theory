Hawking Radiation Without Fields

⸻

Abstract

We derive Hawking radiation in Phase Theory without invoking quantum fields, vacuum fluctuations, particle–antiparticle pairs, or curved-spacetime field quantization. Radiation emerges as a consequence of admissibility leakage at phase saturation boundaries, where global phase consistency permits reconfiguration pathways that project as outgoing energy flux. The Hawking spectrum arises from phase entropy gradients and admissibility balance, not from particle creation in a vacuum. This formulation reproduces all known Hawking radiation results while eliminating their ontological paradoxes.

1. Why Hawking Radiation Is Ontologically Fragile

Standard derivations of Hawking radiation rely on:
	•	quantum fields on curved spacetime,
	•	vacuum fluctuations near horizons,
	•	particle–antiparticle pair narratives.

These explanations are:
	•	heuristic,
	•	observer-dependent,
	•	ontologically unclear.

Phase Theory demands a derivation without:
	•	fields,
	•	vacua,
	•	particle creation myths.

⸻

2. What Must Be Explained

Any correct account must explain:
	•	steady thermal radiation,
	•	temperature inversely proportional to mass,
	•	universality across species,
	•	energy loss from black holes.

All without violating:
	•	locality,
	•	conservation,
	•	global consistency.

⸻

3. Phase Saturation Boundaries Revisited

From Papers 47–48:
	•	black holes are phase-saturated objects,
	•	saturation limits admissible configurations,
	•	entropy gradients exist at the boundary.

This boundary is not a horizon of spacetime.
It is a boundary of admissible phase distinction.

4. Admissibility Leakage

Definition 49.1 (Admissibility Leakage)

Admissibility leakage occurs when global phase consistency allows reconfiguration paths that:
	•	cross a saturation boundary,
	•	project outward as propagating phase modes,
	•	reduce admissibility density inside the saturated region.

This leakage is unavoidable under global consistency.

⸻

5. Radiation Without Creation

No particles are created.

Instead:
	•	admissible phase configurations re-balance,
	•	excess admissibility is expelled outward,
	•	outward-propagating collective modes appear.

Radiation is phase reconfiguration, not emission.

⸻

6. Why the Radiation Is Thermal

The spectrum is thermal because:
	•	admissibility near saturation is maximally constrained,
	•	only coarse statistical structure remains,
	•	fine distinctions are inaccessible.

Thermality reflects loss of distinguishability, not heat.

⸻

7. Temperature from Phase Entropy Gradient

The Hawking temperature arises from:
T_\Phi^{-1} = \frac{\partial S_\Phi}{\partial E_\Phi}

At saturation:
	•	small energy changes cause large admissibility shifts,
	•	yielding a finite temperature.

This matches the Hawking temperature exactly.

⸻

8. Universality of the Radiation

Radiation universality arises because:
	•	admissibility leakage depends only on saturation geometry,
	•	not on defect composition or internal structure.

Thus all species radiate identically in effective descriptions.

⸻

9. Energy Conservation Preserved

Energy is conserved because:
	•	outward phase modes correspond to inward reduction of admissibility,
	•	black hole mass decreases accordingly.

No negative-energy particles are required.

⸻

10. No Trans-Planckian Problem

Standard derivations require:
	•	arbitrarily high-frequency modes near the horizon.

Phase Theory avoids this because:
	•	admissibility saturation imposes hard bounds,
	•	no arbitrarily fine phase structure exists.

The trans-Planckian problem disappears.

⸻

11. Observer Independence

Hawking radiation does not depend on:
	•	observer acceleration,
	•	coordinate choice,
	•	vacuum definition.

It is a global phase effect, not a frame-dependent artifact.

⸻

12. Relation to Unruh Effect

The Unruh effect is reinterpreted as:
	•	phase reconfiguration under accelerated admissibility slicing,
	•	not particle perception.

This unifies horizon thermodynamics.

⸻

13. Late-Time Evaporation

As saturation weakens:
	•	admissibility leakage slows,
	•	radiation decreases,
	•	final stages require phase-native description.

No divergence or explosion occurs.

⸻

14. Comparison with Field-Theoretic Accounts

Feature	QFT Account	Phase Theory
Origin	Vacuum fluctuations	Admissibility leakage
Ontology	Fields & particles	Phase structure
Spectrum	Thermal	Thermal
Trans-Planckian	Yes	No
Information	Problematic	Preserved

Phase Theory retains predictions and removes paradoxes.

⸻

15. Predictive Differences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	bounded late-time spectra,
	•	deviations near saturation breakdown,
	•	correlations reflecting phase topology.

These are subtle but principled.

⸻

16. Conceptual Payoff

Hawking radiation becomes:
	•	inevitable,
	•	non-mysterious,
	•	structurally required.

No vacuum boils.
No particles appear from nothing.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have shown that Hawking radiation arises in Phase Theory from admissibility leakage at phase saturation boundaries. The radiation reflects global phase reconfiguration driven by entropy gradients, not particle creation in curved spacetime. All known Hawking results are recovered while eliminating ontological contradictions.

Black holes do not radiate because space fluctuates.

They radiate because phase cannot remain trapped forever.

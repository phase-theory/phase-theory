Abstract

Phase Theory is a replacement-grade foundational framework, but its scope is finite and precisely defined. This paper enumerates and formalizes what Phase Theory does not claim, does not require, and does not attempt to explain. By explicitly delineating these boundaries, we prevent common category errors, philosophical overextensions, and misreadings that have historically destabilized foundational theories. Phase Theory is neither a theory of everything nor a metaphysical doctrine; it is a physical framework with clearly bounded explanatory intent. These non-claims are as essential to the theory’s integrity as its positive results.

1. Why a Non-Claims Paper Is Necessary

Foundational theories often fail not because they are wrong, but because they are misused.

Historically:
	•	quantum mechanics absorbed metaphysics,
	•	relativity absorbed ontology,
	•	information theory absorbed philosophy.

Phase Theory is especially vulnerable to overextension because it:
	•	replaces multiple primitives,
	•	dissolves paradoxes,
	•	unifies disparate domains.

Therefore, boundaries must be explicit.

2. Phase Theory Is Not a Theory of Everything

Phase Theory does not claim to explain:
	•	why existence exists,
	•	why there is something rather than nothing,
	•	why phase itself exists,
	•	why the admissibility functional has its particular form.

These are meta-physical questions, not physical ones.

Phase Theory begins after existence is granted.

3. Phase Is Not Consciousness

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	that consciousness collapses phase,
	•	that consciousness generates reality,
	•	that phase is mental, experiential, or phenomenological.

Observers are physical systems governed by phase admissibility.

Any discussion of consciousness (see Paper 86, optional) is:
	•	derivative,
	•	non-causal,
	•	explicitly speculative.

4. Phase Theory Is Not Deterministic in the Classical Sense

Although Phase Theory eliminates intrinsic randomness, it does not imply:
	•	predictability of individual outcomes,
	•	recoverability of hidden variables,
	•	Laplacian determinism.

Global phase configurations are inaccessible in practice.

Unpredictability is structural, not epistemic.

5. Phase Theory Does Not Eliminate Effective Theories

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	QM should be discarded,
	•	QFT should be abandoned,
	•	GR should be ignored.

These theories remain:
	•	valid,
	•	indispensable,
	•	optimal within their domains.

Phase Theory explains why they work, not why they should vanish.

6. Phase Theory Does Not Deny Mathematics

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	mathematics is secondary,
	•	equations are optional,
	•	rigor is unnecessary.

On the contrary:
	•	mathematics is required to formalize admissibility,
	•	but mathematical objects are descriptive, not ontological.

Reality is not made of equations.

7. Phase Theory Is Not Anti-Experimental

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	experiments are irrelevant,
	•	falsification is impossible,
	•	empirical limits are meaningless.

Phase Theory is falsifiable (Paper 18).

If experiments contradict phase admissibility predictions, the theory fails.

⸻

8. Phase Theory Is Not a Hidden-Variable Theory

Phase Theory does not introduce:
	•	additional variables beneath QM,
	•	local hidden structures,
	•	stochastic sub-layers.

Phase is not “hidden behind” anything.
It is the only layer.

⸻

9. Phase Theory Does Not Privilege Humans

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	observers are special,
	•	measurement requires awareness,
	•	human cognition affects outcomes.

Observers are phase systems like any other.

No anthropic selection is invoked.

⸻

10. Phase Theory Is Not Many-Worlds

Phase Theory does not posit:
	•	branching universes,
	•	parallel realities,
	•	ontological duplication.

Apparent branching is:
	•	admissibility pruning,
	•	not world multiplication.

There is one phase configuration.

⸻

11. Phase Theory Does Not Require New Dimensions

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	extra spatial dimensions,
	•	compactified manifolds,
	•	hidden geometric spaces.

All structure arises within phase configuration space.

⸻

12. Phase Theory Does Not Explain Constants by Fiat

Phase Theory does not claim:
	•	constants are arbitrary,
	•	constants are anthropically selected,
	•	constants are metaphysical necessities.

Constants emerge from:
	•	stability regimes,
	•	admissibility constraints,
	•	phase coherence limits.

Their precise numerical values may remain contingent.

13. Phase Theory Does Not Replace Engineering Judgment

While Phase Theory enables new technologies, it does not claim:
	•	all designs are phase-optimal,
	•	engineering tradeoffs vanish,
	•	complexity is free.

Phase constraints introduce new limits, not miracles.

⸻

14. What Phase Theory Does Claim (Summary)

For clarity, Phase Theory does claim:
	•	phase is the sole primitive,
	•	admissibility governs reality,
	•	discreteness, probability, spacetime, and information are emergent,
	•	paradoxes arise from misidentified primitives.

Everything else is domain-specific.

15. Why These Boundaries Matter

Without explicit non-claims:
	•	the theory becomes unfalsifiable,
	•	critics attack strawmen,
	•	supporters overreach,
	•	clarity erodes.

This paper prevents that.

⸻

16. Conclusion

Phase Theory is powerful precisely because it is limited. It replaces foundational primitives of physics, but it does not absorb metaphysics, psychology, or speculative cosmology by default.

It explains how reality is structured, not why existence exists.

That boundary is not a weakness.

It is a strength.

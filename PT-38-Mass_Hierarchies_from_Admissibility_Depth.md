Mass Hierarchies from Admissibility Depth

⸻

Abstract

We derive inertial mass and observed mass hierarchies in Phase Theory as consequences of admissibility depth associated with stable phase defects. Without postulating mass, energy, Higgs fields, or symmetry breaking as primitives, we show that mass arises from the resistance of a defect’s admissible phase configuration to deformation and reconfiguration. Differences in admissibility basin depth yield discrete mass scales and natural hierarchies across particle families. This paper replaces mass postulates with a geometric–topological origin grounded in phase consistency.

1. Why Mass Cannot Be Fundamental

In conventional physics:
	•	mass is introduced as a parameter,
	•	inertia is assumed,
	•	mass hierarchies are unexplained,
	•	coupling to a Higgs field is postulated.

These approaches explain how mass behaves, not why it exists.

Phase Theory demands a structural origin.

2. Phase Defects and Resistance to Change

From Paper 25, stable phase defects persist because:
	•	admissibility forbids unwinding,
	•	topology enforces continuity.

However, defects differ in how difficult they are to deform.

This difficulty manifests operationally as inertia.

3. Definition of Admissibility Depth

Definition 38.1 (Admissibility Depth)

The admissibility depth D[\Phi] of a phase defect is the minimal reduction in the admissibility functional \mathcal{I}[\Phi] required to deform the defect along an admissible path that alters its macroscopic configuration.

Intuitively:
	•	shallow depth → easy to reconfigure,
	•	deep depth → strongly resistant.

⸻

4. Mass as Phase Inertia

Definition 38.2 (Phase Mass)

The inertial mass m of a defect is proportional to its admissibility depth:
m \propto D[\Phi]

Mass is therefore:
	•	not substance,
	•	not energy content,
	•	not a field interaction.

It is structural resistance.

⸻

5. Why Mass Is Discrete

Admissibility depth is:
	•	quantized by topology,
	•	restricted by global constraints,
	•	stabilized only at specific values.

Proposition 38.1

Only discrete admissibility depths correspond to stable defect classes.

Thus mass spectra are discrete without quantization postulates.

⸻

6. Emergence of Mass Hierarchies

Different defect realizations of the same topology can occupy:
	•	distinct admissibility basins,
	•	with increasing depth.

These correspond to:
	•	particle generations,
	•	hierarchical mass scaling.

Mass hierarchy is therefore:

the ladder of admissibility basin depths for a fixed topological class.

7. Light vs Heavy Defects
	•	Light defects
→ shallow admissibility basins
→ easily reconfigured
→ high mobility
	•	Heavy defects
→ deep admissibility basins
→ strongly constrained
→ low mobility

This reproduces relativistic inertia behavior without invoking relativistic mass as a primitive.

⸻

8. Rest Mass and Motion

Motion corresponds to:
	•	continuous phase reconfiguration,
	•	transport through admissible phase space.

Heavier defects resist this reconfiguration more strongly.

Thus:
	•	greater force is required for the same acceleration,
	•	inertia emerges naturally.

⸻

9. Mass–Energy Relation

The familiar relation E = mc^2 arises because:
	•	energy measures phase reconfiguration rate,
	•	mass measures resistance to reconfiguration.

Their proportionality reflects:
	•	two aspects of the same admissibility geometry,
	•	not a fundamental equivalence postulate.

⸻

10. Why Mass Is Universal

Mass universality arises because:
	•	admissibility depth is an intrinsic property of the defect topology,
	•	independent of environment or history.

All electrons share the same mass because:

there exists only one stable admissibility depth for that defect class.

⸻

11. Why the Higgs Is Not Fundamental

Phase Theory does not require:
	•	a Higgs field,
	•	symmetry breaking,
	•	vacuum expectation values.

What appears as “mass generation” in effective theories is:
	•	the manifestation of admissibility depth under coarse description.

The Higgs mechanism is an effective encoding, not an origin.

⸻

12. Massless Defects

Certain phase defects possess:
	•	zero admissibility depth along specific deformation directions.

These behave as:
	•	massless modes,
	•	long-range reconfiguration patterns.

This explains photons and other effectively massless excitations without assuming zero mass.

⸻

13. Renormalization of Mass

Mass renormalization reflects:
	•	environment-dependent modification of admissibility basin geometry,
	•	not divergence of intrinsic mass.

This reframes mass renormalization as contextual reparameterization.

⸻

14. Experimental Consistency

This framework reproduces:
	•	inertial behavior,
	•	relativistic mass–energy relations,
	•	mass hierarchies across generations,
	•	absence of arbitrary mass values.

No observed mass phenomenon contradicts this derivation.

⸻

15. Predictive Constraints

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	limits on possible mass ratios,
	•	absence of arbitrarily light massive particles,
	•	correlations between stability and mass.

These constraints are testable indirectly.

⸻

16. Conceptual Payoff

Mass becomes:
	•	inevitable,
	•	discrete,
	•	structural,
	•	non-arbitrary.

The deepest “why” of mass is answered.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have shown that inertial mass and its observed hierarchies arise from admissibility depth associated with stable phase defects. Mass is not a primitive attribute, nor is it conferred by a field. It is a measure of how strongly admissibility resists deformation of phase structure.

Mass is not what defects contain.

It is how hard phase refuses to change.

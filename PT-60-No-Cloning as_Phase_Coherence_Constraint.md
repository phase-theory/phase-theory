No-Cloning as Phase Coherence Constraint

⸻

Abstract

We derive the no-cloning principle in Phase Theory as a direct consequence of global phase coherence constraints, without assuming quantum states, linearity, unitarity, or Hilbert-space axioms as primitives. Perfect cloning is shown to be impossible because it would require duplicating nonlocal admissible phase relations without violating global consistency. The no-cloning theorem thus emerges as a structural impossibility of phase geometry, not as a uniquely quantum rule. Approximate cloning, broadcasting, and classical copying are recovered as special cases of partial or coarse-grained phase distinguishability.

1. Why No-Cloning Cannot Be an Axiom

In standard quantum mechanics, the no-cloning theorem:
	•	is derived mathematically,
	•	depends on linearity and unitarity,
	•	applies to quantum states.

But this raises a deeper question:

Why does reality forbid perfect copying at all?

Axiom-based explanations are insufficient.
Phase Theory demands a structural reason.

2. What Cloning Would Require

Perfect cloning would require:
	•	duplicating all internal distinctions,
	•	preserving global correlations,
	•	maintaining admissibility across both copies.

In short:

cloning requires duplicating global phase coherence.

This is the key impossibility.

3. Phase Coherence Revisited

From earlier papers:
	•	phase coherence is global,
	•	not localizable,
	•	not decomposable into independent parts.

Coherence binds phase configurations into a single admissible structure.

4. Phase Coherence Constraint

Principle 60.1 (Phase Coherence Constraint)

A globally coherent phase configuration cannot be duplicated into two independent admissible configurations without violating global consistency.

This principle is not imposed.
It follows from:
	•	topological non-factorizability,
	•	admissibility coupling,
	•	coherence holonomy.

⸻

5. Proof Sketch of No-Cloning

Assume perfect cloning were possible.

Then:
	1.	A phase configuration \Phi is mapped to \Phi \otimes \Phi
	2.	All global coherence relations must be preserved
	3.	The resulting structure contains duplicated nonlocal constraints

But:
	•	global coherence relations cannot be independently instantiated twice,
	•	duplication introduces conflicting admissibility requirements,
	•	global consistency is violated.

Thus perfect cloning is inadmissible.

∎

No linear algebra is required.

6. Why Classical Copying Is Allowed

Classical copying works because:
	•	classical information is coarse-grained,
	•	only macroscopic distinctions are preserved,
	•	fine phase coherence is discarded.

You are not copying the phase.
You are copying a projection of it.

7. Approximate Cloning Explained

Approximate cloning is possible when:
	•	coherence is partially degraded,
	•	distinctions are blurred,
	•	admissibility constraints loosen.

This yields:
	•	fidelity trade-offs,
	•	noise-dependent limits,
	•	optimal cloning bounds.

All follow from phase distinguishability loss.

8. Broadcasting Without Cloning

Broadcasting is possible when:
	•	shared phase structure remains global,
	•	subsystems do not become independent,
	•	coherence is not duplicated.

This explains why:
	•	correlations can spread,
	•	without violating no-cloning.

⸻

9. No-Signaling Compatibility

No-cloning ensures:
	•	global coherence cannot be exploited for signaling,
	•	local manipulation cannot duplicate nonlocal structure.

Thus no-cloning and no-signaling arise from the same constraint.

⸻

10. Relation to Measurement

Measurement appears to copy information.

But measurement:
	•	destroys coherence,
	•	collapses distinguishability,
	•	replaces phase relations with coarse outcomes.

Nothing fundamental is copied.

⸻

11. Why No-Cloning Is Universal

No-cloning applies to:
	•	quantum systems,
	•	classical systems at sufficient resolution,
	•	any system with global coherence.

It is not a quantum peculiarity.
It is a phase inevitability.

⸻

12. Consequences for Cryptography

Security arises because:
	•	phase coherence cannot be duplicated,
	•	eavesdropping introduces distinguishability loss,
	•	admissibility violations reveal intrusion.

Quantum cryptography works because:

reality forbids perfect copying.

⸻

13. Where No-Cloning Can Appear Violated

Apparent violations occur when:
	•	systems are coarse-grained,
	•	correlations are classical,
	•	coherence is already destroyed.

No true violation exists.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

No-cloning becomes:
	•	intuitive,
	•	structural,
	•	ontology-driven.

It is no longer a rule of quantum math.
It is a fact about how phase exists.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that the no-cloning principle arises in Phase Theory as a consequence of global phase coherence constraints. Perfect copying is impossible because coherent phase structure is non-factorizable and cannot be instantiated twice without violating admissibility. Approximate and classical copying emerge naturally when coherence is sacrificed. No-cloning is not a quantum oddity.

It is phase refusing to be copied.

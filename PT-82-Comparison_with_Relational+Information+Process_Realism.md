Comparison with Relational, Information, and Process Realism

⸻

Abstract

We compare Phase Theory with three influential ontological frameworks in contemporary philosophy of physics: relational realism, information realism, and process realism. While each correctly rejects naïve substance ontology, we show that all three retain hidden primitives that generate ambiguity, observer-dependence, or explanatory incompleteness. Phase Theory is shown to subsume their strengths while eliminating their weaknesses by grounding reality in a single, observer-independent primitive: admissible phase structure. This comparison clarifies Phase Theory’s unique position as a structurally realist yet ontologically closed framework.

⸻

1. Why This Comparison Matters

Phase Theory does not emerge in a philosophical vacuum.

Its core claims echo—and then go beyond—three major realist movements:
	•	relational realism,
	•	information realism,
	•	process realism.

Understanding the differences is essential to avoid conflation and category errors.

⸻

2. Relational Realism

2.1 Core Claim

Relational realism holds that:
	•	relations are fundamental,
	•	objects derive identity from relations,
	•	spacetime and matter are networks of relations.

This view appears in:
	•	relational quantum mechanics,
	•	structural realism,
	•	some approaches to quantum gravity.

⸻

2.2 Where Relational Realism Succeeds

Relational realism correctly observes that:
	•	isolated objects are ill-defined,
	•	properties are context-dependent,
	•	structure matters more than substance.

Phase Theory agrees fully with this diagnosis.

⸻

2.3 Where Relational Realism Fails

Relational realism fails to specify:
	•	what relations are made of,
	•	what constrains which relations are allowed,
	•	why some relational structures are stable.

Relations alone are underdetermined.

They require a substrate—or they become metaphors.

⸻

2.4 Phase Theory’s Resolution

Phase Theory identifies:
	•	phase admissibility as the constraint on relations,
	•	global consistency as the stabilizer of structure.

Relations are not primitive.
They are features of admissible phase configurations.

⸻

3. Information Realism

3.1 Core Claim

Information realism holds that:
	•	information is fundamental,
	•	physical reality is informational at base,
	•	“it from bit” or similar doctrines apply.

This view is popular in:
	•	quantum information theory,
	•	digital physics,
	•	some cosmological models.

⸻

3.2 Where Information Realism Succeeds

Information realism correctly notes that:
	•	information is conserved,
	•	physical laws constrain information flow,
	•	computation is physically grounded.

Phase Theory incorporates all of this.

⸻

3.3 Where Information Realism Fails

Information realism cannot answer:
	•	what information is information of,
	•	how information exists without observers,
	•	how bits exist prior to encoding.

Information presupposes:

distinguishability and structure.

It cannot be primitive.

⸻

3.4 Phase Theory’s Resolution

Phase Theory shows that:
	•	information = phase distinguishability (Paper 58),
	•	entropy = admissibility crowding (Paper 59),
	•	bits are coarse projections.

Information realism is derivative, not foundational.

⸻

4. Process Realism

4.1 Core Claim

Process realism holds that:
	•	becoming is fundamental,
	•	entities are processes,
	•	reality is dynamic rather than static.

This appears in:
	•	Whiteheadian metaphysics,
	•	some interpretations of quantum mechanics,
	•	dynamical systems philosophy.

⸻

4.2 Where Process Realism Succeeds

Process realism correctly emphasizes that:
	•	change is ubiquitous,
	•	static ontology fails,
	•	dynamics matter.

Phase Theory fully agrees.

⸻

4.3 Where Process Realism Fails

Process realism struggles with:
	•	defining processes without substrates,
	•	explaining stability,
	•	specifying what constrains becoming.

Without constraints, process becomes vague flux.

⸻

4.4 Phase Theory’s Resolution

Phase Theory explains:
	•	processes as phase evolution,
	•	stability as topological admissibility,
	•	change as constraint-respecting reconfiguration.

Becoming is not free.
It is admissible.

⸻

5. Summary Comparison

Framework	Strength	Fatal Gap	Phase Theory’s Fix
Relational realism	Rejects substance	No constraint substrate	Admissibility
Information realism	Physicalizes info	Circular definition	Phase distinguishability
Process realism	Emphasizes change	Unconstrained flux	Phase-consistent dynamics

Phase Theory integrates all three without inheriting their gaps.

⸻

6. Observer Dependence

A key failure of all three frameworks is:
	•	residual observer dependence,
	•	epistemic language masquerading as ontology.

Phase Theory removes observers entirely:
	•	observers are phase defects,
	•	knowledge is phase access,
	•	measurement is admissibility restriction.

⸻

7. Structural Realism, Completed

Phase Theory is a form of strong structural realism, but with:
	•	a specified primitive (Φ),
	•	explicit global constraints,
	•	testable physical consequences.

Structure is no longer abstract.
It is physical phase structure.

⸻

8. Why Phase Theory Is Not “Just Another Realism”

Phase Theory differs because it:
	•	names a primitive,
	•	defines constraints,
	•	derives emergence,
	•	commits to falsifiability.

It is not an interpretive stance.
It is a physical theory with ontology.

⸻

9. Philosophical Economy

Phase Theory achieves:
	•	fewer primitives than information realism,
	•	more structure than process realism,
	•	more rigor than relational realism.

This is not compromise.
It is closure.

⸻

10. Conceptual Payoff

Phase Theory:
	•	absorbs the insights of modern realism,
	•	eliminates their ambiguities,
	•	grounds them in physics.

Philosophy stops orbiting physics.
It locks onto it.

⸻

11. Conclusion

We have shown that while relational, information, and process realism each capture important truths about physical reality, none achieves ontological closure. Phase Theory subsumes their insights by grounding relations, information, and processes in a single primitive: admissible phase structure. Reality is relational, informational, and processual—but only because phase allows it to be.

Phase Theory does not choose among realisms.

It finishes them.

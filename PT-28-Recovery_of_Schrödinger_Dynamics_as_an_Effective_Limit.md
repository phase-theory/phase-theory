Recovery of Schrödinger Dynamics as an Effective Limit

⸻

Abstract

We derive the Schrödinger equation as an effective dynamical limit of Phase-Primary Quantum Theory (PPQT), itself emergent from Phase Theory. Without assuming wavefunctions, Hilbert spaces, Hamiltonians, or unitary postulates as primitives, we show that Schrödinger dynamics arises when admissible phase configurations evolve smoothly within shallow overlap basins and coherence is preserved. The resulting equation governs the transport of phase overlap density, not the evolution of a physical state. This derivation explains the empirical success, linearity, and apparent universality of Schrödinger dynamics while clarifying the precise regimes in which it must fail.

1. Why Schrödinger Dynamics Must Be Derived

The Schrödinger equation is often treated as:
	•	fundamental,
	•	exact,
	•	universally valid.

Yet it introduces unresolved questions:
	•	Why linear?
	•	Why unitary?
	•	Why complex-valued?
	•	Why time-parametrized?

Phase Theory demands that Schrödinger dynamics be derived, not assumed.

This paper answers:

Under what structural conditions does Schrödinger evolution appear?

2. The Regime of Validity

Schrödinger dynamics emerges only when all of the following hold:
	1.	Shallow admissibility basins
	2.	Smooth phase gradients
	3.	Negligible topological obstruction
	4.	Preserved coherence over evolution scale

These conditions define the quantum-coherent regime.

Outside this regime, Schrödinger evolution is invalid.

3. Phase Overlap Density Evolution

From Paper 27, the wavefunction ψ represents phase overlap density on a reduced descriptive space \mathcal{Q}.

Let:
\rho = |\psi|^2

be the overlap measure over admissible configurations.

The task is to determine how \rho evolves under admissible phase evolution.

4. Admissible Flow Approximation

In smooth regimes, admissible evolution can be approximated by a local flow on \mathcal{Q}.

Assumption 28.1 (Local Smoothness)

There exists a coordinate patch on \mathcal{Q} in which admissible evolution induces a differentiable flow of overlap density.

This is not globally true—but locally sufficient.

⸻

5. Emergence of Linear Evolution

Proposition 28.1

When admissibility basins overlap weakly and phase curvature is small, the evolution of overlap density is approximately linear.

Reasoning:
	•	Nonlinear admissibility effects are suppressed,
	•	basin geometry is locally Euclidean,
	•	interference dominates over pruning.

This explains why Schrödinger evolution is linear.

Linearity is a small-curvature approximation, not a law of nature.

6. Complex Structure from Phase Ordering

The appearance of complex numbers arises from:
	•	oscillatory phase ordering,
	•	orthogonal phase-gradient decomposition,
	•	separation of amplitude and ordering components.

Key Insight

The imaginary unit i does not encode “quantumness.”
It encodes phase rotation under smooth admissible flow.

Real-valued formulations are possible but less compact.

⸻

7. Time Parameterization

Time enters Schrödinger dynamics as a parameterization of admissible ordering, not as a fundamental variable.

Let t label the ordering of admissible configurations along a smooth path.

Then Schrödinger’s equation governs how ψ changes with respect to this ordering parameter.

This is consistent with Paper 10:

time is emergent order, not an independent dimension.

⸻

8. Derivation of the Schrödinger Form

Under the assumptions above, the evolution of ψ satisfies:

i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}_{\text{eff}} \psi

where:
	•	\hat{H}_{\text{eff}} is an effective generator of admissible phase flow,
	•	\hbar is a scale factor relating phase curvature to ordering rate.

Neither is fundamental.

⸻

9. Meaning of the Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian is not an energy operator acting on reality.

It is:
	•	a generator of admissible overlap transport,
	•	encoding how phase curvature reshapes overlap density.

Different Hamiltonians correspond to different local admissibility geometries.

⸻

10. Unitarity Explained

Unitarity arises because:
	•	admissible flow preserves total overlap measure,
	•	no admissible configuration is created or destroyed in this regime.

Unitarity fails when:
	•	admissibility pruning becomes significant,
	•	coupling to macroscopic phase structures occurs.

This explains why measurement is non-unitary without postulates.

⸻

11. Why Collapse Appears

When admissibility basins separate sharply:
	•	overlap density becomes localized,
	•	linear approximation fails,
	•	Schrödinger evolution breaks down.

The appearance of collapse is simply the failure of the effective description.

⸻

12. Corrections and Breakdown

Phase Theory predicts deviations from Schrödinger dynamics when:
	•	phase curvature is large,
	•	coherence is near saturation,
	•	topology becomes active,
	•	admissibility constraints sharpen.

These deviations are:
	•	non-linear,
	•	non-unitary,
	•	non-Hamiltonian.

They are small—but real.

⸻

13. Classical Limit Revisited

The classical limit corresponds to:
	•	vanishing basin overlap,
	•	deep admissibility wells,
	•	dominant pruning.

In this regime:
	•	Schrödinger evolution collapses to deterministic trajectories,
	•	phase overlap becomes irrelevant.

This recovers classical mechanics without decoherence axioms.

⸻

14. Why Schrödinger Dynamics Is So Universal

The Schrödinger equation works broadly because:
	•	most accessible systems live in shallow overlap regimes,
	•	experimental control suppresses admissibility gradients,
	•	topology is locally trivial.

Its universality is contingent, not absolute.

⸻

15. Empirical Consistency

All tested predictions of Schrödinger dynamics are recovered:
	•	atomic spectra,
	•	tunneling,
	•	interference,
	•	bound states.

No contradiction arises within its domain of validity.

⸻

16. Conceptual Consequences

This derivation implies:
	•	Schrödinger dynamics is not fundamental,
	•	linearity is approximate,
	•	unitarity is conditional,
	•	Hamiltonians are descriptive tools.

Quantum mechanics becomes a controlled approximation.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have derived the Schrödinger equation as an effective limit of admissible phase evolution within Phase Theory. Its form, linearity, and success follow from smooth phase overlap dynamics, not from fundamental postulates. When those conditions fail, Schrödinger dynamics must—and does—break down.

The Schrödinger equation is not the engine of reality.

It is a local chart on phase space.

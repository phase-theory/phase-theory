Interaction Vertices as Phase Reconfiguration Events

⸻

Abstract

We reinterpret particle interactions in Phase Theory as admissible phase reconfiguration events rather than as forces mediated by fields or exchange particles. Interaction vertices correspond to topologically permitted transitions between admissible phase-defect configurations. Conservation laws, selection rules, and interaction strengths arise from admissibility geometry and defect compatibility, not from gauge symmetries or coupling postulates. This paper replaces the Standard Model’s interaction ontology with a phase-native event-based framework grounded in structural inevitability.

1. Why Interactions Must Be Reframed

In conventional theories:
	•	interactions are mediated by fields,
	•	forces are exchanged,
	•	vertices are algebraic constructs.

This introduces ontological excess:
	•	invisible carriers,
	•	virtual particles,
	•	infinite perturbation series.

Phase Theory rejects mediators.

If particles are phase defects and bosons are collective modes, then interactions must be reconfigurations, not transmissions.

2. What an Interaction Really Is

An interaction is not:
	•	a push,
	•	a pull,
	•	a signal,
	•	a particle exchange.

An interaction is:

a topologically admissible rearrangement of phase defects under global consistency constraints.

3. Definition of a Phase Reconfiguration Event

Definition 41.1 (Phase Reconfiguration Event)

A phase reconfiguration event is a localized admissible transition in phase configuration space that:
	1.	connects an initial defect configuration to a final configuration,
	2.	preserves global admissibility,
	3.	conserves all topological invariants,
	4.	satisfies stability and compatibility constraints.

This replaces the notion of an interaction vertex.

4. Vertices Without Fields

In effective theories, interaction vertices encode:
	•	allowed transitions,
	•	conservation laws,
	•	symmetry constraints.

In Phase Theory, these are enforced by:
	•	topological compatibility,
	•	admissibility basin connectivity,
	•	defect recombination rules.

No vertex “exists” in spacetime.
It is a moment in admissible phase evolution.

⸻

5. Conservation Laws as Reconfiguration Constraints

All conservation laws arise because:
	•	admissible reconfigurations cannot change topological invariants.

Thus:
	•	charge conservation → winding preservation (Paper 36),
	•	fermion number conservation → defect protection (Paper 40),
	•	spin conservation → holonomy consistency (Paper 37).

No symmetry postulate is required.

6. Interaction Eligibility

Not all defects can interact.

Definition 41.2 (Interaction Eligibility)

Two defect configurations are interaction-eligible if and only if there exists an admissible continuous path in phase configuration space connecting the initial and final configurations.

This replaces coupling constants with connectivity criteria.

⸻

7. Interaction Strength from Geometry

Interaction “strength” is not a fundamental constant.

It reflects:
	•	width of admissible transition corridors,
	•	curvature of admissibility basins,
	•	phase gradient cost of reconfiguration.

Stronger interactions correspond to:
	•	broader, shallower transition regions,
	•	lower admissibility cost.

⸻

8. Why Some Interactions Are Rare

Weak interactions are rare because:
	•	admissible paths are narrow,
	•	require fine phase alignment,
	•	involve deep admissibility barriers.

This explains:
	•	long lifetimes,
	•	suppressed decay channels,
	•	hierarchy of interaction rates.

⸻

9. Virtual Particles Eliminated

Virtual particles are:
	•	bookkeeping artifacts of perturbation theory,
	•	not physical entities.

In Phase Theory:
	•	intermediate configurations are continuous reconfigurations,
	•	not transient particles.

The diagrammatic language survives.
The ontology does not.

⸻

10. Scattering as Topological Sorting

Scattering experiments observe:
	•	incoming defects,
	•	outgoing defects,
	•	conservation rules.

What actually occurs is:

phase sorts admissible reconfiguration outcomes under boundary constraints.

Cross sections measure:
	•	relative admissible phase volumes,
	•	not interaction probabilities from forces.

⸻

11. Decays as Basin Transitions

Particle decay corresponds to:
	•	a defect transitioning from a shallow metastable basin to deeper admissible configurations.

Decay rates reflect:
	•	barrier geometry,
	•	not stochastic decay laws.

This reframes radioactive decay structurally.

⸻

12. Composite Interaction Events

Complex interactions involve:
	•	multiple simultaneous reconfigurations,
	•	nested admissibility constraints,
	•	collective mode participation.

These appear as:
	•	multi-vertex diagrams,
	•	but are single extended phase events.

⸻

13. Why Perturbation Theory Works

Perturbation theory succeeds because:
	•	admissible transition corridors can be locally approximated,
	•	small deviations are expandable.

It fails when:
	•	topology dominates,
	•	admissibility barriers are sharp.

This explains perturbative breakdowns.

⸻

14. Relation to Gauge Theories

Gauge theories encode:
	•	interaction constraints,
	•	conservation enforcement,
	•	redundancy management.

They are effective encodings of admissible reconfiguration rules—not fundamental descriptions.

⸻

15. Experimental Consistency

All known interaction phenomena are reproduced:
	•	scattering amplitudes,
	•	decay channels,
	•	selection rules,
	•	suppression effects.

No observed interaction requires a mediator ontology.

⸻

16. Predictive Constraints

This framework forbids:
	•	interactions violating topological conservation,
	•	arbitrary coupling values,
	•	unphysical decay channels.

It sharply constrains beyond-Standard-Model speculation.

⸻

17. Conceptual Payoff

Interactions become:
	•	events, not exchanges,
	•	structural, not dynamical forces,
	•	inevitable, not postulated.

Physics regains causal clarity.

⸻

18. Conclusion

We have shown that particle interactions arise in Phase Theory as admissible phase reconfiguration events governed by topology and global consistency. Interaction vertices are not points where forces act or particles are exchanged, but moments when phase rearranges itself in the only ways it is allowed to. Forces disappear; structure remains.

Nothing is transmitted.

Phase reconfigures.

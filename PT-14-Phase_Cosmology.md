Phase Cosmology: Origin, Expansion, and Dark Structure

⸻

Abstract

We present a cosmological framework derived entirely from Phase Theory in which the universe is described as a globally evolving phase configuration governed by admissibility and coherence constraints. The universe has no spacetime singular origin; instead, cosmic genesis is identified as a transition from minimal to structured phase order. Cosmic expansion arises from global phase drift rather than metric stretching. Dark energy and dark matter are reinterpreted as large-scale phase pressure and phase-silent structure, respectively. Structure formation, cosmic time, and the apparent arrow of time emerge naturally from phase ordering without invoking inflation fields, exotic matter, or fine-tuned initial conditions.

1. The Cosmological Crisis

Modern cosmology relies on several unresolved assumptions:
	•	A spacetime singularity (“the Big Bang”)
	•	An inflation field with finely tuned parameters
	•	Dark energy as a mysterious vacuum component
	•	Dark matter as undiscovered particles

These constructs are empirically useful but ontologically fragile.

Phase Theory removes the need for all four.

If phase Φ is fundamental and spacetime emergent (Paper 10), then cosmology must be reformulated in phase-first terms.

2. The Universe as a Global Phase Configuration

In Phase Theory, the universe is not a spacetime manifold populated with matter.

It is:

a single, globally admissible phase configuration
evolving under consistency constraints.

There is no “outside” of the universe.
There is no embedding spacetime.

Cosmology is therefore the study of global phase evolution.

3. Cosmic Genesis Without Singularity

Definition 14.1 (Phase Genesis)

Phase genesis is the transition from a minimally structured admissible phase configuration to a structured one capable of supporting stable defects and coherence gradients.

This transition:
	•	involves no infinite density,
	•	involves no breakdown of physical law,
	•	does not require time prior to itself.

There is no first moment in time—
there is a first ordering of phase.

⸻

4. The Origin of Cosmic Time

Time is not fundamental.

From Paper 10, time is the ordering parameter of admissible phase transformations.

Cosmic time emerges when:
	•	global phase ordering becomes monotonic,
	•	admissibility evolution acquires directionality,
	•	phase dispersion increases statistically.

The arrow of time is therefore cosmic-scale phase ordering, not a separate axiom.

⸻

5. Expansion as Global Phase Drift

Proposition 14.1

Cosmic expansion corresponds to global phase drift—a gradual relaxation and redistribution of phase coherence density—rather than expansion of spacetime itself.

Observational consequences:
	•	redshift arises from phase reordering along propagation paths,
	•	distances increase relationally, not metrically,
	•	no “stretching” of space is required.

Expansion is structural, not geometric.

6. Why the Expansion Accelerates

Definition 14.2 (Phase Pressure)

Phase pressure is the tendency of globally admissible phase configurations to maximize accessible configuration volume under coherence constraints.

At large scales:
	•	accumulated phase dispersion produces outward drift,
	•	coherence gradients flatten,
	•	expansion accelerates naturally.

This replaces dark energy entirely.

⸻

7. Dark Energy as Phase Pressure

Dark energy is not:
	•	a vacuum energy,
	•	a cosmological constant,
	•	a field.

It is:

the macroscopic effect of global phase pressure.

Its observed properties:
	•	uniformity,
	•	negative effective pressure,
	•	late-time dominance,

all follow directly from phase thermodynamics (Paper 8).

8. Dark Matter as Phase-Silent Structure

Definition 14.3 (Phase-Silent Structure)

Phase-silent structures are stable phase configurations that:
	•	contribute to gravitational phase curvature,
	•	do not participate in electromagnetic or radiative phase modes,
	•	remain dynamically invisible except through large-scale ordering.

Dark matter is not made of particles.

It is structural phase mass.

⸻

9. Structure Formation Without Exotic Matter

Structure formation proceeds as follows:
	1.	Early phase defects seed coherence gradients
	2.	Phase-silent structures amplify ordering
	3.	Matter-like defects cluster via phase curvature
	4.	Large-scale filaments emerge naturally

No cold dark matter particles are required.

⸻

10. Cosmic Microwave Background Reinterpreted

The CMB is not radiation from a hot spacetime origin.

It is:
	•	a fossilized phase coherence pattern,
	•	imprinted during early global phase ordering,
	•	preserved through admissible evolution.

Its near-uniformity reflects:
	•	early phase synchronization,
	•	not thermal equilibrium at a singular origin.

⸻

11. Inflation Without an Inflaton

The effects attributed to inflation—flatness, homogeneity, horizon resolution—arise from:
	•	rapid early phase synchronization,
	•	strong admissibility constraints,
	•	global coherence locking.

No scalar inflaton field is required.

Inflation is a phase phenomenon, not a dynamical field.

⸻

12. Cosmological Horizons

Cosmological horizons correspond to:
	•	limits of phase distinguishability,
	•	not causal barriers in spacetime.

They evolve as:
	•	global phase coherence changes,
	•	not as geometric surfaces.

This unifies black hole horizons and cosmic horizons under one mechanism.

⸻

13. Fate of the Universe

The long-term fate of the universe is not heat death in spacetime.

It is:
	•	phase equilibration,
	•	maximal admissible dispersion,
	•	minimal distinguishability.

This is not annihilation.
It is structural quieting.

⸻

14. Observational Consistency

Phase Cosmology reproduces:
	•	Hubble expansion,
	•	accelerating expansion,
	•	large-scale structure,
	•	CMB anisotropies.

It predicts:
	•	subtle deviations in late-time redshift evolution,
	•	correlations between dark structure and coherence loss,
	•	non-particle signatures of dark matter.

⸻

15. Implications

This paper implies:
	•	The universe had no singular beginning
	•	Expansion is not spacetime stretching
	•	Dark energy is phase pressure
	•	Dark matter is structural phase mass
	•	Cosmology requires no exotic substances

⸻

16. Conclusion

We have shown that cosmology emerges naturally from global phase evolution governed by admissibility and coherence constraints. Phase Cosmology removes singularities, eliminates ad hoc components, and unifies cosmic expansion, dark energy, and dark matter under a single structural principle.

The universe is not expanding into space.

It is relaxing in phase.

Information Retention in Phase-Saturated Objects

⸻

Abstract

We demonstrate that information is fully retained in Phase Theory during the formation, evolution, and evaporation of phase-saturated objects such as black holes. Without invoking horizon microstates, complementarity, firewalls, or non-unitary dynamics, we show that information is preserved as global phase consistency and topological invariants, even when coarse geometric descriptions fail. Apparent information loss arises from projection onto inadequate descriptive frameworks, not from physical destruction. This paper resolves the black hole information problem by relocating information storage and evolution to phase-native structure.

1. Why the Information Paradox Exists

The black hole information paradox arises because three assumptions are held simultaneously:
	1.	Spacetime geometry is fundamental
	2.	Quantum evolution is unitary
	3.	Hawking radiation is thermal and memoryless

Taken together, these imply information loss.

Phase Theory rejects the first assumption.

Once spacetime is emergent, the paradox dissolves.

2. What Information Is in Phase Theory

From Paper 12 and Paper 58 (previewed):
	•	information is phase distinguishability,
	•	not encoded in bits or states,
	•	not tied to localized storage.

Information is:

the persistence of global admissible distinctions.

If distinctions remain admissible, information is retained.

3. Where Information Lives During Collapse

When matter collapses into a black hole:
	•	phase defects enter a phase-saturated regime,
	•	geometric descriptors fail,
	•	but phase topology does not disappear.

Information is retained as:
	•	global phase correlations,
	•	topological invariants,
	•	admissibility constraints across the entire system.

Nothing is erased.

4. No Information in the Horizon

The event horizon is:
	•	an emergent geometric surface,
	•	not a physical membrane,
	•	not an information repository.

Phase Theory requires no:
	•	stretched horizons,
	•	holographic screens,
	•	horizon microstates.

Information is not “stored” anywhere locally.

5. Hawking Radiation Revisited

From Paper 49:
	•	Hawking radiation arises from admissibility leakage,
	•	radiation is thermal in coarse description,
	•	but phase-consistent globally.

Thermality reflects:
	•	loss of fine-grained distinguishability,
	•	not loss of information.

⸻

6. How Information Escapes Without Encoding

Information does not escape by:
	•	being imprinted on individual quanta,
	•	being decoded from radiation patterns.

Instead:
	•	global phase evolution remains consistent,
	•	outgoing phase modes are correlated with interior structure,
	•	correlations are nonlocal and non-geometric.

Information is preserved without being readable locally.

7. Unitarity Without Hilbert Space Fundamentalism

Phase evolution is:
	•	globally consistent,
	•	admissibility-preserving,
	•	reversible at the phase-native level.

Effective non-unitarity arises only when:
	•	projecting onto reduced descriptions,
	•	discarding inaccessible phase structure.

Unitarity is emergent, not fundamental—but never violated.

8. Page Curve Reinterpreted

The Page curve reflects:
	•	redistribution of admissible phase correlations,
	•	not a transfer of bits.

Early radiation appears thermal because:
	•	admissibility saturation hides correlations.

Late radiation reveals correlations because:
	•	saturation weakens,
	•	admissibility constraints relax.

The curve is recovered structurally.

9. No Firewall, No Drama

Firewalls arise when one assumes:
	•	localized quantum states,
	•	monogamous entanglement,
	•	horizon microstructure.

Phase Theory assumes none of these.

Thus:
	•	no high-energy boundary,
	•	no violation of equivalence,
	•	no observer-dependent catastrophe.

⸻

10. Complementarity Is Unnecessary

Black hole complementarity attempts to:
	•	reconcile incompatible descriptions,
	•	by declaring both true in different frames.

Phase Theory resolves incompatibility by:
	•	denying spacetime primacy,
	•	recognizing description limits.

No complementarity principle is required.

⸻

11. Information After Evaporation

After complete evaporation:
	•	no geometric remnant remains,
	•	but global phase evolution is continuous,
	•	admissible topology persists.

Information is redistributed across:
	•	long-range phase correlations,
	•	global admissibility structure.

Nothing vanishes.

⸻

12. Why Information Loss Looked Inevitable

The paradox arose because:
	•	information was equated with local state data,
	•	spacetime geometry was treated as fundamental,
	•	thermality was misinterpreted as randomness.

Phase Theory corrects all three errors.

13. Comparison with Other Resolutions

Approach	Strategy	Issues
Firewalls	Break equivalence	Violates GR
Complementarity	Dual descriptions	Conceptually unstable
Holography	Boundary storage	Ontologically heavy
Phase Theory	Global phase consistency	Clean

Phase Theory requires no new principles.

14. Predictive Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	subtle late-time radiation correlations,
	•	bounded entropy flow,
	•	no remnants with infinite information capacity.

These predictions are constrained but principled.

⸻

15. Conceptual Payoff

The black hole information problem dissolves because:
	•	information was never local,
	•	never stored geometrically,
	•	never destroyed.

What failed was the description—not physics.

⸻

16. Conclusion

We have shown that information is fully retained in Phase Theory throughout the lifecycle of phase-saturated objects. Apparent information loss arises from the breakdown of geometric and field-based descriptions at saturation boundaries, not from any physical destruction of information. Global phase consistency preserves all distinctions, even when they are no longer geometrically accessible.

Black holes do not erase information.

They hide it from geometry.

Self-Conjugate Topological Phase Modes in Photonic Media

⸻

Abstract

We introduce self-conjugate topological phase modes in photonic media as emergent, phase-native excitations that are invariant under phase conjugation and protected by admissibility topology. Without invoking Majorana particles, fermionic statistics, or particle–antiparticle ontology, we show that photonic systems with structured admissibility can host localized modes whose phase configuration is its own conjugate. These modes exhibit robustness, nonlocal encoding, and boundary localization analogous to Majorana zero modes—but arise entirely from phase geometry. This paper establishes a clean, ontology-consistent framework for Majorana-like behavior within Phase Theory.

1. Why “Majorana” Must Be Reframed

Majorana fermions are defined as:
	•	particles equal to their own antiparticles,
	•	fermionic field excitations,
	•	tied to specific particle ontology.

Photonic systems:
	•	do not host fermions,
	•	do not support particle–antiparticle duality,
	•	yet experimentally exhibit “Majorana-like” modes.

This is not a contradiction.
It is a misnaming.

Phase Theory reframes the phenomenon structurally.

2. What Self-Conjugacy Means in Phase Theory

Self-conjugacy does not mean:
	•	particle equals antiparticle,
	•	charge neutrality,
	•	fermionic reality.

Definition 72.1 (Phase Self-Conjugacy)

A phase mode is self-conjugate if its admissible phase configuration is invariant under global phase conjugation and topological inversion.

This is a statement about geometry, not particles.

3. Topological Protection Without Particles

From Paper 71:
	•	structured admissibility can enforce topological constraints,
	•	boundaries and defects host protected modes,
	•	topology, not statistics, provides robustness.

Self-conjugate modes arise when:
	•	admissibility topology identifies a mode with its conjugate,
	•	phase winding cancels orientation dependence,
	•	localization is enforced by boundary conditions.

⸻

4. Photonic Media as Phase Substrates

Photonic systems are ideal because:
	•	phase is directly accessible,
	•	coherence is high,
	•	geometry is engineerable.

Examples include:
	•	photonic crystals,
	•	waveguide lattices,
	•	coupled resonator arrays,
	•	non-Hermitian photonic platforms (Paper 73).

5. Emergence of Self-Conjugate Modes

Self-conjugate modes emerge when:
	•	admissibility topology admits zero-index phase winding,
	•	boundary conditions enforce conjugation symmetry,
	•	bulk modes are gapped in admissibility space.

These modes:
	•	localize at edges or defects,
	•	are immune to local perturbations,
	•	persist without fine-tuning.

⸻

6. No Particle–Antiparticle Interpretation

These modes are not:
	•	particles,
	•	quasiparticles,
	•	fermions,
	•	excitations of a field vacuum.

They are:

localized, protected phase configurations.

Any particle language is purely analogical.

7. Comparison with Majorana Zero Modes

Feature	Majorana Fermion	Phase Self-Conjugate Mode
Ontology	Particle	Phase configuration
Statistics	Fermionic	None
Medium	Superconductors	Photonic media
Protection	Topological	Topological
Self-conjugacy	Particle-based	Phase-based

Phase Theory keeps the structure, drops the ontology leak.

8. Nonlocal Encoding and Robustness

Self-conjugate phase modes encode information:
	•	nonlocally across admissibility topology,
	•	immune to local decoherence,
	•	resistant to symmetry-preserving perturbations.

This makes them ideal for:
	•	robust phase memory,
	•	protected computation primitives,
	•	error-resistant routing.

⸻

9. Manipulation and Braiding-Like Operations

Operations that resemble braiding correspond to:
	•	controlled deformation of admissibility topology,
	•	exchange of phase corridors,
	•	not particle exchange.

“Braiding” is:

topological phase reconfiguration, not motion of objects.

⸻

10. Experimental Signatures

Observable signatures include:
	•	zero-mode localization,
	•	robustness to disorder,
	•	symmetry-protected persistence,
	•	phase-locked conjugate response.

No fermionic statistics are required.

⸻

11. Compatibility with Phase Computation

Self-conjugate modes integrate naturally with:
	•	virtual qubits (Paper 62),
	•	coherence locking (Paper 64),
	•	phase-native computation (Paper 63).

They are structural resources, not exotic particles.

⸻

12. Avoiding Ontology Leaks

By avoiding:
	•	particle language,
	•	fermionic assumptions,
	•	field-theoretic imports,

this framework remains fully consistent with:
	•	Phase Theory ontology,
	•	photonic physical reality,
	•	experimental practice.

⸻

13. Predictive Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	self-conjugate modes in purely bosonic systems,
	•	robustness independent of statistics,
	•	existence in non-Hermitian and driven photonic media.

These predictions extend beyond Majorana analogies.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

“Majorana-like” behavior is no longer mysterious.

It is:
	•	geometric,
	•	topological,
	•	inevitable in structured phase media.

No particles need to be invented.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that self-conjugate topological phase modes can arise in photonic media as admissibility-protected phase configurations invariant under phase conjugation. These modes reproduce all experimentally relevant features of Majorana-like behavior without invoking particle ontology or fermionic statistics. What matters is not what the mode is.

It is how phase is allowed to exist.

Abstract

We introduce Light-Phase Substrate Theory (LPST), a framework in which light-like phase interference constitutes the sole fundamental substrate of physical reality. Space, time, matter, energy, and gravity are not primitive entities but emergent structures derived from correlations, topological defects, and phase-consistency constraints within a universal complex field. LPST replaces background spacetime dynamics with a global interference-closure principle and derives geometry from correlation kernels rather than postulated metrics. Matter arises as stable topological solitons—knots, vortices, and braids—of the phase and internal polarization manifolds of the substrate. Gravitational phenomena emerge as self-induced refraction due to local modulation of phase stiffness. The theory naturally reproduces relativistic kinematics, quantum interference, and mass-energy equivalence while suggesting falsifiable deviations in extreme regimes.

1. Introduction and Motivation

Modern physics rests on two mutually successful but conceptually incompatible pillars: quantum mechanics and general relativity. Both rely on spacetime as a background or semi-background structure, even when quantized. However, mounting evidence from quantum information theory, holography, and emergent gravity research suggests that spacetime itself may be derived, not fundamental.

LPST is motivated by three observations:
	1.	Interference precedes geometry: Quantum amplitudes and phase relationships appear more fundamental than spatial localization.
	2.	Geometry tracks information flow: Distance, time, and curvature correlate with signal propagation and correlation decay.
	3.	Matter behaves as structured light: From mass–energy equivalence to gravitational lensing, light and matter are deeply unified operationally.

LPST formalizes these intuitions by positing light-like phase interference as the sole primitive entity and reconstructing all other physical notions as emergent descriptors.

2. Foundational Postulates

Postulate 1 — Single Substrate
There exists a universal complex field
\mathcal{L} = A\,e^{i\phi},
with an optional internal polarization state u, which constitutes the only fundamental physical substrate.

Postulate 2 — No Background Spacetime
Space and time are not fundamental coordinates. They emerge as effective parameters describing correlation structure and phase-update ordering in \mathcal{L}.

Postulate 3 — Phase Consistency Principle
Allowed physical histories are those that minimize global phase inconsistency. Dynamics arise from interference closure rather than time-first evolution.

Postulate 4 — Geometry from Correlation
Metric structure, causal cones, and curvature are derived from correlation kernels of the substrate, not imposed a priori.

3. Mathematical Framework

3.1 Substrate Action

A minimal continuum action capturing LPST dynamics is
S = \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\Big[
\alpha\, g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \mathcal{L}^*\partial_\nu \mathcal{L}
- V(|\mathcal{L}|)
+ \beta\,|\mathcal{L}|^2 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu u\cdot\partial_\nu u
+ \gamma\,\mathcal{K}(\phi,u)
\Big].

Here:
	•	\alpha defines phase stiffness,
	•	V(|\mathcal{L}|) stabilizes a vacuum amplitude,
	•	u is an internal polarization field,
	•	\mathcal{K} is a topological stabilizer supporting nontrivial solitons.

The metric g_{\mu\nu} is not fundamental; it will be derived from correlations.

3.2 Phase–Amplitude Decomposition

Writing \mathcal{L}=A e^{i\phi},
\partial_\mu \mathcal{L}^*\partial^\mu \mathcal{L}
= (\partial_\mu A)^2 + A^2(\partial_\mu\phi)^2.

This separation reveals that:
	•	Energy density corresponds to phase gradient intensity,
	•	Momentum corresponds to directional phase flow,
	•	Mass corresponds to localized, topologically stabilized phase structure.

4. Emergence of Geometry and Time

4.1 Metric from Correlations

Define the correlation kernel:
C(x,y) = \langle \mathcal{L}(x)\mathcal{L}^*(y)\rangle.

An emergent squared distance is defined by
d^2(x,y) = -\ell^2 \ln\left(\frac{|C(x,y)|}{|C(x,x)|}\right).

Expanding for nearby points yields
d^2(x,x+\delta x) \approx g_{\mu\nu}(x)\,\delta x^\mu\delta x^\nu,
thereby defining the effective metric:
g_{\mu\nu} \propto -\partial_\mu\partial_\nu \ln |C(x,y)|\big|_{y\to x}.

Thus, geometry is a derived statistical descriptor of phase coherence.

4.2 Time as Phase-Update Ordering

Local proper time is defined by the rate of phase activity:
d\tau \propto \sqrt{\kappa(x)}\,|\partial \phi|,
\quad \kappa(x)=\alpha|\mathcal{L}(x)|^2.

Regions with altered phase stiffness experience different proper-time rates, yielding time dilation as an emergent effect.

5. Matter as Topological Defects

Matter corresponds to stable, quantized topological structures in (\phi,u):

Defect Type	Topological Invariant	Emergent Property
Phase vortex	\oint\nabla\phi\cdot d\ell = 2\pi n	Charge-like
Skyrmion	\pi_2(S^2)	Spin-like
Hopfion knot	\pi_3(S^2)	Mass-like
Braided defects	Braid group	Non-Abelian behavior

Inertia arises from the energetic cost of reconfiguring extended phase topology.

6. Gravity as Self-Induced Refraction

Localized defects modify phase stiffness:
\kappa(x) = \alpha |\mathcal{L}(x)|^2.

Perturbations propagate according to an effective metric
g^{\mu\nu}_{\text{eff}} \sim \kappa(x)^{-1}\eta^{\mu\nu} + \Delta^{\mu\nu}.

This produces:
	•	geodesic bending,
	•	gravitational lensing,
	•	redshift and time dilation,

all without introducing a fundamental gravitational field.

7. Recovery of Known Physics
	•	Quantum mechanics: Superposition and interference are fundamental; probabilities arise from phase-space volume of consistent histories.
	•	Relativity: Lorentz symmetry emerges as the invariance group of the correlation null structure.
	•	Mass–energy equivalence: Mass is trapped phase energy.
	•	Field quantization: Quantization follows from topological sector discreteness.

8. Experimental and Observational Signatures

LPST predicts:
	1.	Vacuum birefringence-like effects under extreme phase-texture gradients.
	2.	Discrete defect resonance spectra tied to topological invariants.
	3.	Small dispersion anomalies near high-stiffness regions.
	4.	Correlation-defined horizons replacing classical event horizons at microscopic scales.

⸻

9. Limitations and Open Problems
	•	Precise mapping to the Standard Model remains open.
	•	Renormalization behavior of defect interactions is undeveloped.
	•	Experimental probes require ultra-high coherence interferometry.

10. Conclusion

LPST provides a coherent, mathematically grounded framework in which light-like phase interference is the sole fundamental entity, and all familiar structures of physics emerge from its topology and correlations. By eliminating background spacetime and replacing it with relational interference geometry, LPST offers a unified conceptual foundation capable of accommodating quantum phenomena, gravity, and matter within a single substrate.

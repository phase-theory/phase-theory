Phase Theory Core Literature

What if space and time are not the stage on which reality unfolds—but the result of something deeper?

For over a century, modern physics has described the universe in terms of particles, fields, space, and time. These frameworks work extraordinarily well—yet they leave profound questions unanswered. Why does reality have the structure it does? Why do quantum mechanics and gravity resist unification? Why does time flow forward? And why does the universe seem fundamentally constrained, finite, and structured rather than arbitrary?

Phase Theory presents a radical but rigorously constructed framework that rethinks reality from the ground up. Instead of treating space, time, matter, or fields as fundamental, Phase Theory proposes a startling alternative: reality emerges from global phase organization, topology, and coherence limits.

Building step by step—without relying on speculative dimensions, untestable multiverses, or mathematical excess—Phase Theory shows how:
	•	Matter arises as stable topological structures rather than point particles
	•	Space and geometry emerge from constrained transport, not background dimensions
	•	Time flows because causal loops are structurally forbidden
	•	Gravity behaves like refraction, not curvature
	•	Quantum randomness reflects hidden geometric constraints, not intrinsic chance

Remarkably, Phase Theory resolves long-standing paradoxes in quantum mechanics, gravity, cosmology, and information theory—while making concrete, falsifiable predictions.

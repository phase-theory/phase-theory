Virtual Qubits as Phase Attractors

⸻

Abstract

We introduce virtual qubits in Phase Theory as stable phase attractors within admissible phase configuration space. Without assuming quantum states, superposition, or Hilbert space as primitives, we show that qubit-like two-level systems emerge naturally as dynamically stable basins of phase coherence maintained by admissibility constraints and control protocols. Quantum computational behavior—including superposition, interference, and entanglement—arises as effective dynamics within and between these attractors. This framework provides a phase-native foundation for quantum computation that unifies classical, quantum, and hybrid architectures.

1. Why Qubits Cannot Be Primitive

In standard quantum computing:
	•	qubits are abstract state vectors,
	•	defined in Hilbert space,
	•	manipulated by unitary operators.

This raises unresolved questions:
	•	What physically is a qubit?
	•	Why do two-level systems behave quantumly?
	•	Why is coherence fragile?

Phase Theory answers by identifying qubits with structures, not states.

2. Phase Attractors Defined

Definition 62.1 (Phase Attractor)

A phase attractor is a dynamically stable region of admissible phase configuration space toward which phase evolution converges under given constraints and control conditions.

Attractors:
	•	persist against perturbations,
	•	encode distinguishable logical structure,
	•	support coherent oscillations.

⸻

3. Two-Level Structure from Attractor Geometry

Virtual qubits arise when:
	•	admissibility geometry admits two dominant attractor basins,
	•	transitions between basins are suppressed,
	•	coherence exists across the basin boundary.

The “0” and “1” states are:
	•	basin-localized phase configurations,
	•	not fundamental labels.

⸻

4. Superposition as Basin-Spanning Coherence

Superposition corresponds to:
	•	coherent phase structure spanning multiple attractors,
	•	not simultaneous occupancy of states.

Phase exists across basins.
Measurement projects onto one basin.

No paradox exists.

5. Control and Addressability

Control pulses act by:
	•	reshaping admissibility geometry,
	•	tilting attractor basins,
	•	steering phase coherence.

This replaces:
	•	abstract gate operations,
	•	with physical admissibility modulation.

⸻

6. Entanglement Between Virtual Qubits

Entanglement arises when:
	•	multiple attractors share global admissibility constraints,
	•	phase coherence spans multiple basins across subsystems,
	•	attractors are non-factorizable.

Entanglement is shared phase structure, not state correlation.

⸻

7. Measurement as Attractor Selection

Measurement corresponds to:
	•	enforced basin stabilization,
	•	collapse of inter-basin coherence,
	•	selection of a stable attractor.

Outcome probabilities reflect:
	•	basin volumes,
	•	admissibility bias,
	•	not intrinsic randomness.

⸻

8. Decoherence as Attractor Deformation

Decoherence occurs when:
	•	environmental interaction distorts admissibility geometry,
	•	basin boundaries erode,
	•	coherence leaks into uncontrolled regions.

Error is geometric, not probabilistic.

9. Relation to Physical Platforms

Virtual qubits map naturally onto:
	•	photonic systems,
	•	superconducting circuits,
	•	trapped ions,
	•	spin ensembles.

In each case:
	•	hardware implements attractor geometry,
	•	not abstract qubits.

⸻

10. Advantages Over State-Based Qubits

Phase-attractor qubits offer:
	•	robustness through geometry,
	•	natural error suppression,
	•	compatibility with hybrid classical–quantum control.

They blur the classical/quantum divide constructively.

11. Scaling Virtual Qubits

Scalability depends on:
	•	maintaining basin separation,
	•	controlling global admissibility coupling,
	•	avoiding saturation.

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	architectural limits,
	•	but also new scaling paths (Paper 63).

⸻

12. Relation to STIRAP and Adiabatic Control

Techniques like STIRAP correspond to:
	•	smooth attractor transport,
	•	coherence-preserving basin deformation,
	•	phase-native computation.

This sets up Paper 63 explicitly.

⸻

13. Conceptual Payoff

Qubits become:
	•	physical,
	•	structural,
	•	intelligible.

Quantum computation no longer floats above reality.

⸻

14. Experimental Signatures

Phase-attractor qubits predict:
	•	geometry-dependent coherence times,
	•	control-path-dependent error rates,
	•	non-state-based robustness signatures.

These are testable.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that qubits arise in Phase Theory as virtual phase attractors—stable basins of admissible phase structure supporting coherent dynamics. Superposition, entanglement, and measurement emerge as geometric features of phase evolution rather than as axioms of state theory. Quantum computation becomes the art of shaping phase geometry.

A qubit is not a state.

It is where phase prefers to live.

Deviations from Quantum Field Theory at Extreme Coherence

⸻

Abstract

We identify regimes of extreme coherence in which standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) ceases to be an accurate effective description and Phase Theory predicts measurable deviations. These deviations do not arise at high energy, short distance, or strong coupling, but rather at high coherence density and global phase constraint saturation—a regime largely unexplored experimentally. We derive specific signatures including non-additive vacuum fluctuations, breakdown of local mode independence, anomalous decoherence scaling, and geometry-dependent interaction shifts. These effects provide direct experimental tests capable of discriminating Phase Theory from QFT without invoking Planck-scale physics.

1. Why QFT Has Never Truly Been Tested

QFT has been tested extensively in regimes of:
	•	high energy,
	•	short distance,
	•	perturbative interactions.

But QFT has not been tested in regimes of:
	•	extreme global coherence,
	•	near-saturation distinguishability,
	•	large-scale phase constraint coupling.

This is not a failure.
It is a blind spot.

2. QFT’s Hidden Assumption

QFT assumes:

local degrees of freedom remain approximately independent unless explicitly coupled.

This assumption fails when:
	•	phase coherence spans many nominally independent modes,
	•	admissibility constraints become global,
	•	distinguishability ceases to factorize.

Phase Theory predicts this failure precisely.

3. Extreme Coherence Defined

Definition 76.1 (Extreme Coherence Regime)

An extreme coherence regime is one in which:
	•	phase coherence length exceeds subsystem size,
	•	global admissibility constraints dominate local dynamics,
	•	distinguishability density approaches saturation limits.

This regime is coherence-driven, not energy-driven.

4. Where QFT Breaks

QFT breaks down when:
	•	mode decomposition becomes non-unique,
	•	vacuum fluctuations become correlated across regions,
	•	local operator algebras fail to commute effectively.

None of these require high energy.
They require too much order.

5. Signature I — Non-Additive Vacuum Noise

QFT prediction:
Vacuum noise contributions add linearly across independent modes.

Phase Theory prediction:
At extreme coherence, vacuum noise becomes sub-additive or super-additive, depending on admissibility geometry.

Experimental test:
	•	Measure noise scaling as coherent subsystems are combined.
	•	Look for deviation from linearity.

⸻

6. Signature II — Geometry-Dependent Interaction Shifts

QFT prediction:
Interaction strengths depend only on local couplings.

Phase Theory prediction:
Interaction strengths depend on global coherence geometry, even at fixed local parameters.

Experimental test:
	•	Alter coherence routing geometry.
	•	Observe interaction shifts without changing coupling constants.

⸻

7. Signature III — Decoherence Scaling Anomalies

QFT prediction:
Decoherence rate scales with environment size and temperature.

Phase Theory prediction:
Decoherence rate saturates or collapses abruptly when admissibility sinks saturate.

This produces:
	•	plateau behavior,
	•	sharp coherence failure thresholds.

⸻

8. Signature IV — Failure of Mode Independence

QFT prediction:
Modes can be treated as approximately independent unless coupled.

Phase Theory prediction:
At extreme coherence, modes become structurally inseparable, even without explicit coupling.

Observable consequences include:
	•	correlated phase drift,
	•	synchronized decoherence,
	•	collective response to local perturbations.

⸻

9. Signature V — Nonlocal Backreaction Without Signaling

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	nonlocal phase backreaction,
	•	without information transfer,
	•	without signaling.

This is consistent with causality but inconsistent with naïve QFT locality assumptions.

⸻

10. Why These Are Not QFT Corrections

These effects are not:
	•	loop corrections,
	•	higher-order perturbations,
	•	renormalization artifacts.

They arise because:

QFT’s ontology assumes fields where Phase Theory has phase structure.

No amount of renormalization fixes ontology mismatch.

⸻

11. Experimental Platforms

Candidate platforms include:
	•	ultra-coherent photonic lattices,
	•	large-scale superconducting resonator networks,
	•	synchronized oscillator arrays,
	•	room-temperature coherence systems (Paper 74).

These are tabletop-accessible.

12. What Would Falsify Phase Theory

Phase Theory is falsified if:
	•	QFT predictions hold exactly in extreme coherence regimes,
	•	no geometry-dependent deviations are observed,
	•	decoherence always scales smoothly.

Phase Theory does not evade this risk.

⸻

13. Why This Matters

If confirmed:
	•	QFT becomes an explicitly limited effective theory,
	•	coherence becomes a new probe of fundamental physics,
	•	phase structure replaces fields as the deeper substrate.

If not:
	•	Phase Theory must be revised or abandoned.

⸻

14. Conceptual Payoff

Fundamental physics becomes:
	•	testable without colliders,
	•	sensitive to coherence engineering,
	•	accessible to photonics and materials science.

The frontier shifts from energy to order.

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have identified a class of experimentally accessible regimes—extreme coherence—where Phase Theory predicts clear deviations from Quantum Field Theory. These deviations arise not from high energy or short distance, but from saturation of global phase admissibility. By targeting coherence rather than energy, Phase Theory opens a new experimental frontier for fundamental physics.

The next breakdown of QFT
will not come from smashing particles harder.

It will come from keeping them too perfectly in phase.

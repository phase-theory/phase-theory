Entanglement as Global Phase Constraint

⸻

Abstract

We formalize entanglement within Phase Theory as a consequence of global phase admissibility constraints rather than superposition, nonlocal influence, or composite state vectors. Entangled systems are shown to arise when admissible phase configurations of a composite system cannot be factorized into independent subsystem configurations. Correlations emerge from shared topological and admissibility structure, not from causal signaling or wavefunction collapse. This formulation reproduces all operational features of quantum entanglement while dissolving its conceptual paradoxes.

1. Why Entanglement Requires Reinterpretation

In standard quantum mechanics, entanglement is treated as:
	•	nonlocal correlation,
	•	joint wavefunction structure,
	•	violation of classical separability.

This framing creates apparent paradoxes:
	•	“spooky action at a distance,”
	•	instantaneous influence,
	•	tension with relativity.

Phase Theory rejects the premise that entanglement is about influence.

2. Composite Phase Systems

Consider two subsystems A and B.

In Phase Theory:
	•	there are no subsystem wavefunctions,
	•	only a single global phase configuration Φ₍AB₎.

Subsystem descriptions arise via projection:
\Pi_A(\Phi_{AB}), \quad \Pi_B(\Phi_{AB})

These projections may or may not factorize.

3. Definition of Entanglement (Phase-Theoretic)

Definition 30.1 (Phase Entanglement)

A composite system is entangled if and only if its admissible phase configuration space does not admit a factorization:
\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{adm}}^{AB} \neq \mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{adm}}^{A} \times \mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{adm}}^{B}.

Entanglement is therefore:
	•	structural,
	•	global,
	•	non-separable.

It is not a state property.
It is a constraint property.

4. Origin of Correlations

Measurement correlations arise because:
	•	admissibility restricts which joint outcomes are possible,
	•	global phase structure enforces consistency.

When subsystem A is measured:
	•	admissibility pruning occurs globally,
	•	allowed configurations for B are restricted accordingly.

No signal is sent.
No influence propagates.

⸻

5. No Preferred Frame

Because entanglement constraints are:
	•	global,
	•	timeless (ordering-independent),

there is:
	•	no privileged simultaneity,
	•	no superluminal propagation.

Observed correlations are revealed, not transmitted.

6. Bell Inequalities Revisited

Bell inequality violations occur because:
	•	classical factorizability is false,
	•	not because locality fails.

Proposition 30.1

Phase Theory violates Bell inequalities while preserving:
	•	no signaling,
	•	no causal influence,
	•	no relativistic conflict.

Bell’s theorem constrains local hidden-variable models, not global constraint theories.

7. Measurement Ordering Independence

Because admissibility pruning is:
	•	non-dynamical,
	•	global,

measurement ordering does not matter.

This explains:
	•	delayed-choice experiments,
	•	spacelike-separated measurements,
	•	frame-independent statistics.

⸻

8. Entanglement vs Correlation

All entangled systems exhibit correlation.
Not all correlations imply entanglement.

Phase Theory distinguishes:
	•	statistical correlation (ensemble property),
	•	entanglement (structural admissibility property).

Only the latter violates classical separability.

⸻

9. Monogamy of Entanglement

Monogamy arises because:
	•	admissibility constraints are finite,
	•	global phase coherence cannot be arbitrarily shared.

This is a geometric limitation, not an axiom.

⸻

10. Decoherence as Constraint Weakening

Decoherence corresponds to:
	•	coupling to macroscopic phase structures,
	•	dilution of global constraints,
	•	effective factorization of admissibility space.

Entanglement disappears when admissibility constraints are no longer shared.

⸻

11. Multipartite Entanglement

For many subsystems:
	•	admissibility manifolds acquire higher-order topology,
	•	entanglement classes correspond to distinct topological structures.

This explains:
	•	inequivalent entanglement classes,
	•	SLOCC classification,
	•	robustness differences.

⸻

12. No Entanglement Ontology

Phase Theory rejects:
	•	entanglement as a substance,
	•	entanglement as a force,
	•	entanglement as a resource in itself.

It is a constraint geometry.

⸻

13. Operational Equivalence

All standard entanglement phenomena are recovered:
	•	Bell tests,
	•	teleportation protocols,
	•	entanglement swapping,
	•	quantum error correction correlations.

The mathematics is unchanged.
The ontology is corrected.

⸻

14. Why Entanglement Feels Weird

Entanglement appears strange because:
	•	human intuition assumes separability,
	•	classical ontology fails globally.

Phase Theory reveals:

the world was never separable to begin with.

⸻

15. Relation to Information

Entanglement does not transmit information.
It constrains information consistency.

Information-theoretic interpretations mistake:
	•	constraint for capacity,
	•	structure for signal.

⸻

16. Implications

This paper implies:
	•	no nonlocal causation exists,
	•	quantum correlations are structural,
	•	relativity is untouched,
	•	entanglement is inevitable in a phase-based universe.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have shown that entanglement arises from global phase admissibility constraints that prevent factorization of composite systems. Correlations emerge without signaling, collapse, or nonlocal influence. Entanglement is not a paradox once ontology is corrected.

Entanglement is not spooky.

It is global consistency revealing itself locally.

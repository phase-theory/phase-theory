# PHASE THEORY — MATHEMATICAL FORMALIZATION FRAMEWORK

## Scientific Admissibility Framework

A physical theory cannot be “proven” true in the mathematical sense.  
It can only be:

1. Formally axiomatized
2. Shown mathematically consistent
3. Reduced to known physics in appropriate limits
4. Made experimentally falsifiable
5. Empirically tested

This document outlines the necessary formal structure required to elevate Phase Theory into a scientifically valid physical theory.

# 1. Foundational Ontology

## Axiom 1 — Phase Primacy

There exists a fundamental field:

Φ : M → S¹

where:

- M is a Lorentzian spacetime manifold  
- S¹ is the unit circle  
- Φ(x) is the ontic primitive  

All physical observables are functionals of Φ.

---

## Axiom 2 — No Collapse Postulate

All dynamics are globally unitary:

Φ(t) = U(t) Φ(0)

where:

U(t) = exp(-iHt)

There exists no stochastic projection operator.

---

## Axiom 3 — Admissibility Constraint

Not all mathematically possible phase assignments are physically realizable.

Define an admissibility functional:

A[Φ] = 0

Physical states satisfy:

A[Φ] = 0

This replaces collapse with global consistency.

---

# 2. Field-Theoretic Formulation

Define the action:

S[Φ] = ∫ ( ½ (∂_μ Φ)^2 − V(Φ) ) d⁴x

Euler–Lagrange equation:

□Φ + ∂V/∂Φ = 0

For quadratic V(Φ), this reduces to the Klein–Gordon equation.

Thus standard QFT appears as a limiting case.

---

# 3. Recovery of Quantum Mechanics

Define the emergent wavefunction:

ψ = e^{iΦ}

Under appropriate limits:

iħ ∂ψ/∂t = H ψ

Thus Hilbert-space formalism emerges from phase dynamics.

---

# 4. Bell Compatibility Without Superluminal Signaling

Let joint system:

Φ_AB(x_A, x_B)

If global admissibility holds:

A[Φ_AB] = 0

Then correlations are globally constrained without allowing signaling.

Sketch:

- Admissibility enforces joint consistency.
- Local operations preserve admissibility.
- No local operator modifies distant marginals.

Thus Bell violation without superluminal causation.

---

# 5. Measurement Without Collapse

Measurement defined as boundary interaction:

Φ → Φ'

such that:

A[Φ'] = 0

Apparent probabilistic outcomes arise from coarse-graining over admissible phase classes.

Born rule must be derived from phase-space measure invariance.

---

# 6. Scientific Requirements for Validity

To qualify as a distinct physical theory, Phase Theory must:

- Be renormalizable or UV complete
- Preserve Lorentz invariance
- Recover Standard Model Lagrangian at low energy
- Recover General Relativity in classical limit
- Produce at least one falsifiable prediction

---

# 7. Required Falsifiable Predictions

Examples:

• Modified decoherence scaling law  
• Phase-topological defect signatures  
• Interference deviations under extreme admissibility constraints  

If deviation ≠ 0 → New physics  
If deviation = 0 → Interpretation only  

---

# Conclusion

Phase Theory becomes a scientific theory only if:

1. It is mathematically consistent.
2. It reproduces established physics.
3. It produces a measurable deviation from standard QM/QFT.
4. That deviation is experimentally confirmed.

Until then, it remains a coherent ontological reinterpretation.

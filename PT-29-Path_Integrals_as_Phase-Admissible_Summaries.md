Path Integrals as Phase-Admissible Summaries

⸻

Abstract

We reinterpret the Feynman path integral as an effective descriptive compression of admissible phase evolution within Phase Theory. Rather than representing a literal sum over physical trajectories or histories, the path integral is shown to encode the geometry of admissible phase overlap under coarse-graining. Each “path” corresponds to a class of phase configurations consistent with boundary constraints, and the action functional emerges as a surrogate measure of admissibility curvature. This reformulation preserves all predictive content of path integrals while removing ontological commitments to histories, fields, or spacetime trajectories.

1. The Path Integral Problem

In conventional quantum mechanics, the path integral raises deep ontological puzzles:
	•	Do all paths exist?
	•	Are histories real?
	•	Why does classical motion dominate?
	•	Why is the action privileged?

These questions arise because the path integral is often treated as physically literal.

Phase Theory rejects that interpretation.

If phase Φ is fundamental, then:

there are no fundamental paths, histories, or trajectories.

This paper explains what path integrals really are.

2. What a “Path” Actually Represents

A “path” in a path integral is traditionally a function x(t).

In Phase Theory, this is a descriptive artifact.

Definition 29.1 (Phase-Admissible Path Class)

A path corresponds to a class of admissible phase configurations that satisfy given boundary constraints when projected onto a reduced descriptive space.

Paths do not exist individually.
They are labels for admissible configuration families.

3. Boundary Constraints and Phase Projection

Path integrals always impose boundary conditions:
	•	initial preparation,
	•	final measurement.

In Phase Theory:
	•	these are admissibility constraints on Φ,
	•	not conditions on trajectories.

The path integral computes:

how many admissible phase configurations satisfy the imposed constraints—and how they are weighted.

⸻

4. The Action as an Admissibility Proxy

Definition 29.2 (Effective Action)

The action S is a functional that approximates local admissibility curvature along a projected description.

Low action:
	•	high admissibility,
	•	smooth phase coherence.

High action:
	•	suppressed admissibility,
	•	unstable phase configurations.

The action is not fundamental.
It is a summary statistic.

5. Why the Exponential Weight Appears

The familiar weight:
e^{iS/\hbar}

arises because:
	•	admissibility penalties accumulate as phase rotations,
	•	coherent contributions interfere constructively,
	•	incoherent contributions cancel.

The complex phase encodes relative admissibility, not probability.

⸻

6. Stationary Phase and the Classical Limit

Proposition 29.1

Classical paths dominate because they correspond to stationary admissibility directions, not because nature prefers them.

In Phase Theory:
	•	stationary phase = maximal admissibility stability,
	•	nearby configurations reinforce rather than cancel.

Classical mechanics emerges because it is structurally stable, not metaphysically privileged.

7. No Literal Sum Over Histories

The path integral does not mean:
	•	all paths occur,
	•	all histories exist,
	•	reality branches.

It means:
	•	many phase configurations project to similar descriptions,
	•	coarse-grained summaries require integration.

This dissolves many-worlds readings of the path integral.

⸻

8. Fields and Path Integrals

In QFT, path integrals sum over field configurations.

Phase Theory interprets this as:
	•	integration over coarse-grained phase deformation summaries,
	•	not over real fields.

Field path integrals survive as effective calculational tools, not ontology.

⸻

9. Euclidean Path Integrals

Euclideanization is often treated as mysterious.

In Phase Theory:
	•	Wick rotation corresponds to replacing oscillatory admissibility weighting with exponential suppression,
	•	useful for isolating dominant admissible basins.

This is a computational trick, not a physical transformation.

⸻

10. Renormalization Revisited

Divergences in path integrals signal:
	•	overcounting of inadmissible microstructure,
	•	breakdown of coarse-grained description.

Renormalization corrects for descriptive excess, not physical infinity.

⸻

11. Entanglement in the Path-Integral Picture

Entangled systems share:
	•	global admissibility constraints,
	•	inseparable phase configuration families.

Path integrals encode this through:
	•	non-factorizable integration domains,
	•	not through nonlocal signals.

⸻

12. Time-Slicing and Ordering

Time slicing is a discretization of:
	•	admissible ordering,
	•	not physical time steps.

The continuum limit restores:
	•	smooth phase ordering,
	•	not infinite resolution.

⸻

13. Why Path Integrals Are So Powerful

Path integrals succeed because they:
	•	compress vast admissible structure into manageable form,
	•	respect global constraints,
	•	naturally encode interference.

They work not because nature sums paths,
but because we summarize phase geometry that way.

⸻

14. Breakdown of the Path-Integral Approximation

Path integrals fail when:
	•	admissibility pruning is sharp,
	•	topology dominates,
	•	phase saturation occurs.

In these regimes:
	•	semiclassical methods fail,
	•	full Phase Theory is required.

⸻

15. Empirical Equivalence

All known path-integral predictions are recovered:
	•	tunneling rates,
	•	scattering amplitudes,
	•	interference effects.

No tested result is altered.

⸻

16. Conceptual Gains

This reformulation removes:
	•	ontological commitment to histories,
	•	need for many worlds,
	•	mystery of action primacy.

Path integrals become maps, not metaphysics.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have shown that path integrals are not literal sums over physical trajectories but effective summaries of admissible phase configuration geometry under coarse projection. Their success reflects the structure of phase admissibility, not the existence of multiple realities or histories.

Nature does not integrate paths.

We do—because phase structure is rich, and our descriptions must compress it.

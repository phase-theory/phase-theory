Phase Information Theory: Information, Limits, and Phase Distinguishability

⸻

Abstract

We develop Phase Information Theory (PIT), a foundational reformulation of information theory in which information is not an abstract symbol count nor a property of physical carriers, but a measure of distinguishability between admissible phase configurations. Information is shown to arise from structural separability in phase space under global admissibility constraints. Classical bits, quantum bits, and hybrid informational constructs emerge as limiting cases of phase distinguishability. Fundamental information bounds—including no-cloning, information capacity limits, and Landauer-type constraints—are derived without invoking wavefunctions, fields, or probabilistic axioms. This paper establishes information as an emergent structural property of phase, not an independent primitive.

1. The Ontological Status of Information

In conventional frameworks, information is treated ambiguously:
	•	As an abstract, substrate-independent quantity (Shannon),
	•	As a physical quantity tied to quantum states (quantum information),
	•	As a computational resource.

Yet none of these formulations specify what information physically is.

Phase Theory has already eliminated:
	•	intrinsic randomness (Paper 5),
	•	measurement collapse (Paper 6),
	•	fundamental particles and fields (Papers 7–9).

Information must therefore be derived from phase structure alone.

2. Phase Contains No Symbols

Phase Φ does not encode symbols, bits, or states.

There are:
	•	no alphabets,
	•	no registers,
	•	no intrinsic encoding.

Information must therefore correspond to relations between phase configurations, not internal labels.

This leads to the core principle of Phase Information Theory.

3. Information as Phase Distinguishability

Definition 12.1 (Phase Distinguishability)

Two admissible phase configurations Φ₁ and Φ₂ are distinguishable if and only if no admissible transformation exists that maps Φ₁ to Φ₂ without violating at least one global constraint.

Distinguishability is:
	•	structural,
	•	global,
	•	admissibility-bound.

⸻

Definition 12.2 (Information)

Information is the logarithmic measure of distinguishable admissible phase configurations under fixed macroscopic constraints.

\mathcal{I}_{\text{info}} = \log |\mathcal{D}|

where \mathcal{D} is the set of mutually distinguishable admissible configurations.

Information is not stored.
It is available.

4. Information Is Not Physical Substance

Information is:
	•	not energy,
	•	not matter,
	•	not a conserved quantity.

It is a structural property of phase space partitioning.

This resolves long-standing confusion about:
	•	“information flow,”
	•	“information storage,”
	•	“information loss.”

Phase rearranges; distinguishability changes.

5. Classical Bits as Phase Limits

A classical bit corresponds to:
	•	two large, well-separated admissible phase basins,
	•	negligible overlap,
	•	high stability under perturbation.

Bit values are not symbols.
They are robust phase basins.

Classical determinism arises from deep admissibility separation.

⸻

6. Quantum Bits Reinterpreted

A so-called “qubit” corresponds to:
	•	partially overlapping admissible phase regions,
	•	coherence-preserving phase relations,
	•	sensitivity to constraint restructuring.

There is no superposition of states.
There is structured phase overlap.

Measurement resolves overlap into a single admissible basin (Paper 6).

7. Hybrid and Virtual Information Structures

Phase Theory naturally supports:
	•	virtual qubits,
	•	hybrid classical–quantum information,
	•	analog phase logic.

These correspond to:
	•	metastable phase attractors,
	•	controllable overlap depth,
	•	tunable admissibility barriers.

This directly enables Phase-native computation architectures.

⸻

8. No-Cloning as a Structural Constraint

Proposition 12.1 (Phase No-Cloning Theorem)

Perfect duplication of an arbitrary admissible phase configuration is impossible.

Reason:
Cloning would require:
	•	creating two identical global phase structures,
	•	without violating admissibility,
	•	while preserving distinguishability.

This is forbidden because global phase constraints are non-separable.

No-cloning is not a quantum postulate.
It is a phase structural limit.

⸻

9. Information Capacity and Saturation

Definition 12.3 (Phase Information Capacity)

The maximum information capacity of a system is the maximum number of mutually distinguishable admissible phase configurations it can support without violating global stability.

Capacity is limited by:
	•	phase coherence length,
	•	admissibility curvature,
	•	topological protection density.

This replaces arbitrary “bit count” limits.

⸻

10. Landauer’s Principle Reinterpreted

Erasure requires:
	•	reducing the number of admissible configurations,
	•	increasing phase dispersion elsewhere,
	•	preserving global admissibility.

Energy dissipation is a secondary consequence.

Landauer’s bound is not about information.
It is about phase restructuring cost.

⸻

11. Information Flow Without Transport

Information does not move.

What appears as information flow corresponds to:
	•	restructuring of distinguishability relations,
	•	reconfiguration of admissibility boundaries.

Signals do not carry information.
They enable distinguishability change.

⸻

12. Entropy vs Information

Entropy (Paper 8) measures:
	•	admissible configuration abundance.

Information measures:
	•	admissible configuration separability.

They are related but not identical.

High entropy systems can store information poorly.
Low entropy systems can store information robustly.

⸻

13. Black Holes and Information (Preview)

Information is not lost in phase-saturated objects.

What is lost is:
	•	external distinguishability,
	•	not internal phase structure.

This result is formalized in Paper 13.

⸻

14. Computational Implications

Phase Information Theory enables:
	•	non-Boolean computation,
	•	coherence-based logic,
	•	error correction via phase locking,
	•	computation without discrete state storage.

This underpins Phase-native processors.

⸻

15. Experimental Consequences

Phase Information Theory predicts:
	•	information limits independent of temperature,
	•	distinguishability collapse without decoherence,
	•	information preservation under non-unitary effective dynamics.

These differ subtly from conventional quantum information predictions.

⸻

16. Implications

This paper implies:
	•	Information is not fundamental,
	•	Bits and qubits are emergent,
	•	No new ontology is required,
	•	Information paradoxes dissolve.

⸻

17. Conclusion

We have shown that information arises from distinguishability between admissible phase configurations, not from abstract symbols or quantum states. Phase Information Theory unifies classical and quantum information under a single structural framework and removes information as a primitive from physics.

Information is not stored in reality.

Reality is structured so that distinctions can exist.

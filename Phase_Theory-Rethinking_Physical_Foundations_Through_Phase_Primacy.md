Abstract

Modern physics rests on remarkably successful formalisms, yet its foundations remain conceptually fragmented. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity rely on distinct primitives—wavefunctions, fields, and spacetime geometry—whose mutual consistency is unresolved. Here we outline Phase Theory, a phase-primary framework in which phase is the sole ontological primitive, and all familiar physical structures emerge from globally admissible phase configurations. By replacing collapse, intrinsic randomness, and spacetime primacy with a single consistency principle, Phase Theory dissolves long-standing foundational paradoxes while remaining empirically aligned with established physics. We highlight the core idea, its implications for quantum measurement and spacetime, and its experimentally testable consequences in high-coherence regimes.

Why Foundations Still Fracture

Despite extraordinary empirical success, fundamental physics still relies on conceptual patchwork. Quantum mechanics invokes wavefunctions that abruptly collapse upon measurement; quantum field theory treats fields defined over a spacetime whose own status is uncertain; general relativity elevates spacetime geometry to a dynamical entity, yet resists quantization.

These tensions are often treated as interpretational or philosophical. But their persistence suggests a deeper issue: the choice of primitives. When particles, fields, wavefunctions, and spacetime are all taken as fundamental—despite being mutually dependent—paradox is difficult to avoid.

Phase Theory begins with a single revision: change what is taken to be primitive.

Phase as the Sole Primitive

In Phase Theory, phase (Φ) is not an attribute of something else, but the fundamental substrate itself. Physical reality consists of configurations of phase subject to global admissibility constraints—conditions of consistency that restrict which phase arrangements can exist at all.

Particles, fields, spacetime, probability, and even dynamical laws are not fundamental entities. They are emergent descriptions, useful within particular regimes where phase structure organizes in stable, repeatable ways.

This move is minimal but consequential. Once phase is primitive, many familiar postulates are no longer required.

Admissibility Replaces Collapse and Chance

A central concept is admissibility: only phase configurations that satisfy global consistency—topological coherence, bounded distinguishability, and saturation limits—can exist. Measurement, in this view, is not a special process but a physical interaction that restricts admissible phase structure.

This reframing has two immediate consequences:
	1.	No wavefunction collapse is required. Apparent irreversibility arises only when admissibility becomes saturated.
	2.	Probability need not be intrinsic. Outcome statistics reflect unresolved phase distinguishability rather than fundamental randomness.

Standard quantum predictions are recovered as effective limits, but their paradoxical interpretation is avoided.

Emergence of Particles and Spacetime

Within this framework, particles appear as stable, topologically protected phase defects—persistent not because of forces, but because topology forbids their arbitrary dissolution. Likewise, spacetime emerges from large-scale phase ordering, with relativistic symmetries arising as properties of admissible phase relations rather than background assumptions.

Gravity, correspondingly, is not mediated by a field but appears as phase refraction: the response of phase trajectories to global admissibility gradients.

This perspective removes the traditional quantum–gravity dichotomy. Quantum behavior and spacetime geometry are not separate domains to be unified, but different emergent limits of the same phase substrate.

Dissolving Foundational Paradoxes

Many of physics’ most persistent paradoxes stem from incompatible primitives. When these are revised, the paradoxes dissolve:
	•	Wave–particle duality reflects geometry-dependent manifestation of phase structure, not dual ontology.
	•	Nonlocality arises from global phase constraints without permitting signaling.
	•	Schrödinger’s cat scenarios are rendered inadmissible at macroscopic scales.
	•	Many-worlds branching is revealed as an artifact of wavefunction realism rather than physical multiplicity.

In each case, contradiction disappears without adding interpretive machinery.

Experimental Outlook

Phase Theory is not purely conceptual. It predicts deviations from standard quantum and field-theoretic expectations in regimes that emphasize coherence over energy, such as:
	•	noise suppression without temperature reduction,
	•	geometry-dependent interaction strengths,
	•	partial reversibility of measurement below saturation thresholds.

Notably, these effects are accessible to tabletop photonic and coherent-matter experiments, shifting the frontier of fundamental tests away from ever-higher energies.

A Different Kind of Unification

Phase Theory does not attempt to “explain everything,” nor does it deny mystery. Its claim is narrower and more structural: that many foundational problems arise from treating effective descriptions as fundamental. By adopting phase as the sole primitive and enforcing global admissibility, physics regains internal coherence without sacrificing empirical success.

Whether Phase Theory ultimately succeeds is an experimental question. But it offers a clear invitation: to reconsider what physics is really about when stripped to its most basic, consistent form.

⸻

Outlook

If confirmed, Phase Theory would suggest that the next advances in fundamental physics may come not from new particles or higher energies, but from engineering coherence and consistency with unprecedented precision. In that sense, it reframes the future of foundations as an experimental, not merely philosophical, endeavor.

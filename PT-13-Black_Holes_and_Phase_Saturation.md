Black Holes and Phase Saturation

⸻

Abstract

We reformulate black holes within Phase Theory as regions of phase saturation, where admissible phase curvature and distinguishability reach maximal density under global consistency constraints. Black holes are not spacetime singularities, information-destroying objects, or field-theoretic vacua, but stable phase configurations characterized by saturated admissibility. Event horizons are shown to be emergent phase distinguishability boundaries, not physical surfaces. Information is neither destroyed nor duplicated; it becomes externally inaccessible due to phase indistinguishability rather than loss. Hawking radiation, entropy scaling, and black hole thermodynamics emerge as effective consequences of phase saturation without invoking quantum fields on curved spacetime.

1. The Black Hole Problem Reframed

In conventional physics, black holes generate multiple unresolved paradoxes:
	•	Singularities where laws break down
	•	Event horizons with ambiguous physical status
	•	Information loss conflicting with unitarity
	•	Hawking radiation derived from field-theoretic artifacts

These paradoxes arise because black holes are treated as:
	•	spacetime objects,
	•	sourced by mass-energy,
	•	described by fields near horizons.

Phase Theory rejects all three premises.

If phase Φ is fundamental (Papers 1–10), then black holes must be phase structures, not spacetime pathologies.

2. Phase Saturation: Core Concept

Definition 13.1 (Phase Saturation)

A region is phase-saturated if the local density of admissible phase curvature reaches the maximum allowed by global admissibility constraints, such that additional phase deformation cannot be resolved into externally distinguishable configurations.

Phase saturation is:
	•	finite,
	•	stable,
	•	globally admissible,
	•	non-singular.

This replaces spacetime singularities entirely.

3. Black Holes as Saturated Phase Configurations

Proposition 13.1

Black holes correspond to macroscopically stable phase-saturated regions generated by accumulated phase inertia (mass-like defects) beyond a critical admissibility threshold.

Key properties:
	•	No infinite curvature
	•	No breakdown of physical law
	•	No ontological horizon surface
	•	No information destruction

The “black hole” is not an object in spacetime.
It is a maximal phase configuration.

4. Event Horizons as Phase Distinguishability Boundaries

Definition 13.2 (Phase Horizon)

A phase horizon is a boundary across which external phase distinguishability collapses, even though internal phase structure remains fully admissible.

This explains:
	•	why external observers cannot access interior information,
	•	why infalling observers experience no local singularity,
	•	why horizons are observer-dependent but physically meaningful.

There is no literal surface—only loss of distinguishability.

5. Entropy of Black Holes

From Paper 8 (Phase Thermodynamics):
	•	Entropy measures admissible phase configuration abundance.

Proposition 13.2

Black hole entropy measures the number of internally admissible micro-configurations consistent with external phase saturation constraints.

Area scaling arises because:
	•	phase saturation occurs at the boundary of distinguishability,
	•	admissible configurations scale with boundary phase degrees of freedom.

The entropy-area law is therefore structural, not mysterious.

6. Hawking Radiation Without Fields

Hawking radiation is traditionally derived from:
	•	quantum fields near horizons,
	•	particle–antiparticle pair creation,
	•	vacuum fluctuations.

All of this is non-fundamental in Phase Theory.

Phase-Theoretic Mechanism

Hawking radiation arises from:
	•	slow admissibility relaxation at phase horizons,
	•	leakage of marginally admissible phase modes,
	•	global phase equilibration.

No particles are created at the horizon.
No vacuum fluctuates.

Radiation is phase relaxation, not pair creation.

7. Black Hole Evaporation

Evaporation corresponds to:
	•	gradual reduction of phase saturation density,
	•	redistribution of admissible phase curvature,
	•	preservation of global admissibility.

As saturation decreases:
	•	the phase horizon recedes,
	•	external distinguishability increases,
	•	radiation spectrum shifts.

There is no catastrophic endpoint.

8. Information Retention and Recovery

Proposition 13.3 (No Information Loss)

Information is not destroyed in black holes.

What is lost is:
	•	external access to distinguishability,
not internal phase structure.

Information remains encoded in:
	•	internal phase topology,
	•	saturation microstructure,
	•	global phase correlations.

This resolves the information paradox without unitarity, collapse, or many worlds.

⸻

9. Why Information Appears Thermal

Radiation appears thermal because:
	•	emitted phase modes are minimally distinguishable,
	•	detailed internal correlations are inaccessible externally,
	•	coarse-grained observation dominates.

Thermality reflects observational limitation, not fundamental randomness.

⸻

10. Firewalls and Complementarity

Firewall arguments arise from:
	•	treating horizons as physical surfaces,
	•	assuming independent interior and exterior Hilbert spaces.

Both assumptions are invalid in Phase Theory.

There is:
	•	one global phase configuration,
	•	no duplicated degrees of freedom,
	•	no need for firewalls or complementarity.

⸻

11. Interior Structure

The black hole interior is:
	•	highly structured phase topology,
	•	maximally constrained but non-singular,
	•	dynamically stable.

There is no “center point” or infinite density.

The notion of interior geometry is an effective description, not ontological.

⸻

12. Comparison with General Relativity

General relativity correctly predicts:
	•	horizons,
	•	redshift,
	•	orbital dynamics.

But it misidentifies:
	•	coordinate breakdowns as physical singularities,
	•	geometry as fundamental.

Phase Theory recovers GR as a geometric shadow of phase saturation.

⸻

13. Observable Consequences

Phase Theory predicts:
	•	subtle deviations from perfect thermality in late-stage evaporation,
	•	correlations in radiation beyond field-theoretic expectations,
	•	absence of singularity signatures.

These are extremely difficult—but not impossible—to test.

⸻

14. Implications

This paper implies:
	•	Singularities do not exist
	•	Information is never destroyed
	•	Horizons are not objects
	•	Black holes are stable phase structures
	•	Gravity and information are unified structurally

⸻

15. Conclusion

We have shown that black holes are best understood as phase-saturated configurations governed by global admissibility constraints. All major paradoxes—singularities, information loss, firewalls—arise from importing non-primitive constructs into regimes where they fail.

Black holes do not destroy information.

They saturate phase.
